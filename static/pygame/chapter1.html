<h1><a name="_Toc316943074"><span style='font-variant:normal !important;
text-transform:uppercase'>Chapter 1 – Installing Python and Pygame</span></a></h1>

</div>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943075">What You Should Know Before You Begin</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It might help if you know a bit about Python programming (or
how to program in another language besides Python) before you read through this
book; however even if you haven’t you can still read this book anyway.
Programming isn’t nearly as hard as people think it is. If you ever run into
some trouble, you can read the free book “Invent Your Own Computer Games with
Python” online at <span class=URL><u>http://inventwithpython.com</u></span> or
look up a topic that you find confusing on the Invent with Python wiki at <span
class=URL><u>http://inventwithpython.com/wiki</u></span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You don’t need to know how to use the Pygame library before
reading this book. The next chapter is a brief tutorial on all of Pygame’s major
features and functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just in case you haven’t read the first book and already
installed Python and Pygame on your computer, the installation instructions are
in this chapter. If you already have installed both of these then you can skip
this chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943076">Downloading and Installing Python</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before we can begin programming you'll need to install
software called the Python interpreter on your computer. (You may need to ask
an adult for help here.) The <span class=Definition>interpreter</span> is a
program that understands the instructions that you’ll write (or rather, type
out) in the Python language. Without the interpreter, your computer won't be
able to run your Python programs. We'll just refer to “the Python interpreter”
as “Python” from now on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Python interpreter software can be downloaded from the
official website of the Python programming language, <span class=URL><u>http://www.python.org</u></span>.
You might want the help of someone else to download and install the Python
software. The installation is a little different depending on if your
computer’s operating system is Windows, Mac OS X, or a Linux OS such as Ubuntu.
You can also find videos online of people installing the Python software on
their computers at <span class=URL><u>http://invpy.com/installing</u></span>.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943077">Windows Instructions</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you get to <span class=URL><u>http://python.org</u></span>,
you should see a list of links on the left (such as “About”, “News”, “Documentation”,
“Download”, and so on). Click on the <strong>Download</strong> link to go to
the download page, then look for the file called “Python 3.2 Windows Installer
(Windows binary -- does not include source)” and click on its link to download
Python for Windows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Double-click on the <em>python-3.2.msi</em> file that you've
just downloaded to start the Python installer. (If it doesn’t start, try
right-clicking the file and choosing <strong>Install</strong>.) Once the
installer starts up, just keep clicking the <strong>Next</strong> button and
just accept the choices in the installer as you go (no need to make any
changes). When the install is finished, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943078">Mac OS X Instructions</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mac OS X 10.5 comes with Python 2.5.1 pre-installed by
Apple. Currently, Pygame only supports Python 2 and not Python 3. However, the
programs in this book work with both Python 2 and 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Python website also has some additional information
about using Python on a Mac at <span class=URL><u>http://docs.python.org/dev/using/mac.html</u></span>.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943079">Ubuntu and Linux Instructions</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pygame for Linux also only supports Python 2, not Python 3. If
your operating system is Ubuntu, you can install Python by opening a terminal
window (from the desktop click on <strong>Applications &gt; Accessories &gt;
Terminal</strong>) and entering “<span class=Literal>sudo apt-get install
python2.7</span>” then pressing Enter. You will need to enter the root password
to install Python, so ask the person who owns the computer to type in this
password if you do not know it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You also need to install the IDLE software. From the terminal,
type in “<span class=Literal>sudo apt-get install idle</span>”. The root
password is also needed to install IDLE (ask the owner of your computer to type
in this password for you).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943080">Starting Python</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will be using the IDLE software to type in our programs
and run them. IDLE stands for <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>D</strong>eve<strong>L</strong>opment
<strong>E</strong>nvironment. The development environment is software that
makes it easy to write Python programs, just like word processor software makes
it easy to write books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your operating system is Windows XP, you should be able
to run Python by clicking the Start button, then selecting Programs, Python
3.1, IDLE (Python GUI). For Windows Vista or Windows 7, just click the Windows
button in the lower left corner, type “IDLE” and select “IDLE (Python GUI)”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your operating system is Max OS X, start IDLE by opening
the Finder window and click on Applications, then click Python 3.2, then click
the IDLE icon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your operating system is Ubuntu or Linux, start IDLE by
opening a terminal window and then type “<span class=Literal>idle3</span>” and
press Enter. You may also be able to click on Applications at the top of the
screen, and then select Programming, then IDLE 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> <img width=147 height=144 id="Picture 7"
src="chapter1_files/image001.webp"> <img width=192 height=144 id="Picture 8"
src="chapter1_files/image002.webp"> <img width=192 height=144 id="Picture 9"
src="chapter1_files/image003.webp"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The window that appears when you first run IDLE is called
the <span class=Definition>interactive shell</span>. A <span class=Definition>shell</span>
is a program that lets you type instructions into the computer. The Python
shell lets you type Python instructions, and the shell sends these instructions
to the Python interpreter to perform.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943081"></a><a name="_Toc316764488">Installing Pygame</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pygame does not come with Python. Like Python, Pygame is
available for free. You will have to download and install Pygame, which is as
easy as downloading and installing the Python interpreter. In a web browser, go
to the URL <span class=URL><u>http://pygame.org</u></span> and click on the
“Downloads” link on the left side of the web site. This book assumes you have
the Windows operating system, but Pygame works the same for every operating
system. You need to download the Pygame installer for your operating system and
the version of Python you have installed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You do not want to download the “source” for Pygame, but
rather the Pygame “binary” for your operating system. For Windows, download the
pygame-1.9.1.win32-py3.2.msi file. (This is Pygame for Python 3.2 on Windows.
If you installed a different version of Python (such as 2.7 or 2.6) download
the .msi file for your version of Python.) The current version of Pygame at the
time this book was written is 1.9.1. If you see a newer version on the website,
download and install the newer Pygame. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Mac OS X, download the .zip or .dmg file for the version
of Python you have and run it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Linux, open a terminal and run “<span class=Literal>sudo
apt-get install python-pygame</span>”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Windows, double click on the downloaded file to install
Pygame. To check that Pygame is install correctly, type the following into the
interactive shell:</p>

<div style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:4.0pt 4.0pt 4.0pt 4.0pt'>

<p class=CodeExample style='border:none;padding:0in'>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pygame</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>If nothing appears after you hit the Enter key, then you
know Pygame has successfully been installed. If the error <span class=Literal>ImportError:
No module named pygame</span> appears, then try to install Pygame again (and
make sure you typed <span class=Literal>import pygame</span> correctly).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter has five small programs that demonstrate how to
use the different features that Pygame provides. In the last chapter, you will
use these features for a complete game written in Python with Pygame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A video tutorial of how to install Pygame is available from
this book's website at <span class=URL><u>http://invpy.com/videos</u></span>.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943082">How to Use This Book</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame” is different from
other programming books because it focuses on the complete source code for several
game programs. Instead of teaching you programming concepts and leaving it up
to you to figure out how to make programs with those concepts, this book shows
you some programs and then explains how they are put together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, you should read these chapters in order. There
are many concepts that are used over and over in these games, and they are only
explained in detail in the first game they appear in. But if there is a game
you think is interesting, go ahead and jump to that chapter. You can always
read the previous chapters later if you got ahead of yourself.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943083">The Featured Programs</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each chapter focuses on a single game program and explain
how different parts of the code work. It is very helpful to copy these programs
by typing in the code line by line from this book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, you can also download the source code file from
this book's website. In a web browser, go to the URL <span class=URL><u>http://invpy.com/source</u></span>
and follow the instructions to download the source code file. But typing in the
code yourself really helps you learn the code better.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943084">Downloading Graphics and Sound Files</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>While you can just type in the code you read out of this
book, you will need to download the graphics and sound files used by the games
in this book from <span class=URL><u>http://invpy.com/downloads</u></span>.
Make sure that these image and sound files are located in the same folder as
the .py Python file otherwise your Python program will not be able to find
these files.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943085">Line Numbers and Spaces</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When entering the source code yourself, do not type the line
numbers that appear at the beginning of each line. For example, if you see this
in the book:</p>

<div style='border:double windowtext 1.5pt;padding:6.0pt 4.0pt 6.0pt 4.0pt'>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpFirst><span class=SourceLineNumber>1. </span>number
= random.randint(1, 20)</p>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpMiddle><span class=SourceLineNumber>2. </span>spam
= 42</p>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpLast><span class=SourceLineNumber>3. </span>print('Hello
world!')</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>You do not need to type the “1.” on the left side, or the
space that immediately follows it. Just type it like this:</p>

<div style='border:double windowtext 1.5pt;padding:6.0pt 4.0pt 6.0pt 4.0pt'>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpFirst>number = random.randint(1, 20)</p>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpMiddle>spam = 42</p>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpLast>print('Hello world!')</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those numbers are only used so that this book can refer to
specific lines in the code. They are not a part of the actual program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aside from the line numbers, be sure to enter the code
exactly as it appears. Notice that some of the lines don’t begin at the
leftmost edge of the page, but are indented by four or eight or more spaces. Be
sure to put in the correct number of spaces at the start of each line. (Since
each character in IDLE is the same width, you can count the number of spaces by
counting the number of characters above or below the line you're looking at.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example in the code below, you can see that the second
line is indented by four spaces because the four characters (“whil”) on the
line above are over the indented space. The third line is indented by another
four spaces (the four characters, “if n” are above the third line's indented
space):</p>

<div style='border:double windowtext 1.5pt;padding:6.0pt 4.0pt 6.0pt 4.0pt'>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpFirst>while spam &lt; 10:</p>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpMiddle>    if number == 42:</p>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpLast>        print('Hello')</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943086">Text Wrapping in This Book</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some lines of code are too long to fit on one line on the
pages in this book, and the text of the code will wrap around to the next line.
When you type these lines into the file editor, enter the code all on one line without
pressing Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can tell when a new line starts by looking at the line
numbers on the left side of the code. For example, the code below has only two
lines of code, even though the first line wraps around:</p>

<div style='border:double windowtext 1.5pt;padding:6.0pt 4.0pt 6.0pt 4.0pt'>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpFirst><span class=SourceLineNumber>1. </span>print('This
is the first line! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx’)</p>

<p class=SourceCodeFeaturedCxSpLast><span class=SourceLineNumber>2. </span>print('This
is the second line, not the third line.')</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943087">Checking Your Code Online</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the programs in this book are a little long.
Although it is very helpful to learn Python by typing out the source code for
these programs, you may accidentally make typos that cause your programs to
crash. It may not be obvious where the typo is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can copy and paste the text of your source code to the
online diff tool on the book’s website. The diff tool will show any differences
between the source code in the book and the source code you’ve typed. This is
an easy way of finding any typos in your program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Copying and pasting text is a very useful computer skill,
especially for computer programming. There is a video tutorial on copying and pasting
at this book’s website at <span class=URL><u>http://invpy.com/copypaste</u></span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The online diff tool is at this web page: <span class=URL><u>http://invpy.com/diff/pygame</u></span>.
There is also a video tutorial on how to use this tool on the book’s website.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc316943088">More Info Links on http://invpy.com</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a lot that you can learn about programming. But you
don’t need to learn all of it now. There are several times in this book where
you might like to learn these additional details and explanations, but if I
included them in this book then it would add many more pages. If this larger,
heavier book accidentally fell on you the weight of these many additional pages
would crush you, resulting in death. Instead, I have included “more info” links
in this book that you can follow on this book’s website. You do not have to
