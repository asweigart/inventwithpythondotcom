</h1>
</header>
<figure class="opener"><img src="images/000017.png" alt="" class="calibre15" /></figure><p class="chapterintro">“The two hardest problems in computer science are naming things, cache invalidation, and off-by-one errors.” This classic joke, attributed to Leon Bambrick and based on a quote by Phil Karlton, contains a kernel of truth: it’s hard to come up with good names, formally called <em class="calibre10">identifiers</em>, for variables, functions, classes, and anything else in programming. Concise, descriptive names are important for your program’s readability. But creating names is easier said than done. If you were moving to a new house, labeling all your moving boxes as “Stuff” would be concise but not descriptive. A descriptive name for a programming book might be <em class="calibre10">Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</em>, but it’s not concise.</p>
<p class="calibre22"><span type="pagebreak" title="60" id="calibre_link-410" class="calibre16"></span>Unless you’re writing “throwaway” code that you don’t intend to maintain after you run the program once, you should put some thought into selecting good names in your program. If you simply use <code class="calibre9">a</code>, <code class="calibre9">b</code>, and <code class="calibre9">c</code> for variable names, your future self will expend unnecessary effort to remember what these variables were initially used for.</p>
<p class="calibre23">Names are a subjective choice that you must make. An automated formatting tool, such as Black, described in Chapter 3, can’t decide what you should name your variables. This chapter provides you with some guidelines to help you choose suitable names and avoid poor names. As always, these guidelines aren’t written in stone: use your judgment to decide when to apply them to your code.</p>

<h2 class="calibre38">Metasyntactic Variables</h2>
<p class="boxbodyfirst">We commonly use a <em class="calibre10">metasyntactic variable</em> in tutorials or code snippets when we need a generic variable name. In Python, we often name variables <code class="calibre41">spam</code>, <code class="calibre41">eggs</code>, <code class="calibre41">bacon</code>, and <code class="calibre41">ham</code> in code examples where the variable name isn’t important. That’s why this book uses these names in code examples; they aren’t meant for you to use them in real-world programs. These names come from Monty Python’s “Spam” sketch (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python)" class="calibre19">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python)</a>). The names <code class="calibre41">foo</code> and <code class="calibre41">bar</code> are also common for metasyntactic variables. These are derived from FUBAR, the World War II era US Army slang acronym that indicates a situation is “[messed] up beyond all recognition.”</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre7">Casing Styles</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">Because Python identifiers are case sensitive and cannot contain whitespace, programmers use several styles for identifiers that include multiple words:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li class="calibre11"><code class="calibre9">snake_case</code> separates words with an underscore, which looks like a flat snake in between each word. This case often implies that all letters are lowercase, although constants are often written in <code class="calibre9">UPPER_SNAKE_CASE</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><code class="calibre9">camelCase</code> separates words by capitalizing the start of each word after the first. This case often implies the first word begins with a lowercase letter. The uppercase letters look like a camel’s humps.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><code class="calibre9">PascalCase</code>, named for its use in the Pascal programming language, is similar to <code class="calibre9">camelCase</code> but capitalizes the first word as well.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre23">Casing is a code formatting issue and we cover it in Chapter 3. The most common styles are <code class="calibre9">snake_case</code> and <code class="calibre9">camelCase</code>. Either is fine to use as long as your project consistently uses one or the other, not both.</p>
<h2 id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre7"><span type="pagebreak" title="61" id="calibre_link-411" class="calibre20"></span>PEP 8’s Naming Conventions</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">The PEP 8 document introduced in Chapter 3 has some recommendations for Python naming conventions:</p>
<ul class="calibre36">
<li class="calibre11">All letters should be ASCII letters&mdash;that is, uppercase and lowercase English letters that don’t have accent marks.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Modules should have short, all lowercase names.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Class names should be written in <code class="calibre9">PascalCase</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Constant variables should be written in uppercase <code class="calibre9">SNAKE_CASE</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Function, method, and variable names should be written in lowercase <code class="calibre9">snake_case</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The first argument for methods should always be named <code class="calibre9">self</code> in lowercase.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The first argument for class methods should always be named <code class="calibre9">cls</code> in lowercase.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Private attributes in classes should always begin with an underscore ( <code class="calibre9">_</code> ).</li>
<li class="calibre11">Public attributes in classes should never begin with an underscore ( <code class="calibre9">_</code> ).</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre23">You can bend or break these rules as required. For example, although English is the dominant language in programming, you can use letter characters in any language as identifiers: <span class="calibre">コンピューター</span><code class="calibre9"> = 'laptop'</code> is syntactically valid Python code. As you can see in this book, my preference for variable names goes against PEP 8, because I use <code class="calibre9">camelCase</code> rather than <code class="calibre9">snake_case</code>. PEP 8 contains a reminder that a programmer doesn’t need to strictly follow PEP 8. The important readability factor isn’t which style you choose but consistency in using that style.</p>
<p class="calibre23">You can read PEP 8’s “Naming Conventions” section online at <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions" class="calibre19">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre7">Appropriate Name Length</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">Obviously, names shouldn’t be too long or too short. Long variable names are tedious to type, whereas short variable names can be confusing or mysterious. Because code is read more often than it’s written, it’s safer to err on the side of too long variable names. Let’s look at some examples of names that are too short and too long.</p>
<h3 id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre27">Too Short Names</h3>
<p class="bodyfirst">The most common naming mistake is choosing names that are too short. Short names often make sense to you when you first write them, but their precise meaning can be lost a few days or weeks later. Let’s consider a few types of short names.</p>
<ul class="calibre36">
<li class="calibre11">A <em class="calibre10">one- or two-letter name</em> like <code class="calibre9">g</code> probably refers to some other word that begins with <em class="calibre10">g,</em> but there are many such words. Acronyms and names <span type="pagebreak" title="62" id="calibre_link-412" class="calibre16"></span>that are only one or two letters long are easy for you to write but difficult for someone else to read. This also applies to . . . </li>
<li class="calibre11">. . . an <em class="calibre10">abbreviated name</em> like <code class="calibre9">mon</code>, which could stand for <em class="calibre10">monitor, month, monster,</em> or any number of words. </li>
<li class="calibre11">A <em class="calibre10">single-word name</em> like <code class="calibre9">start</code> can be vague: the start of what? Such names could be missing context that isn’t readily apparent when read by someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre23">One- or two-letter, abbreviated, or single-word names might be understandable to you, but you always need to keep in mind that other programmers (or even you a few weeks into the future) will have difficulty understanding their meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre23">There are some exceptions where short variable names are fine. For example, it’s common to use <code class="calibre9">i</code> (for <em class="calibre10">index</em>) as a variable name in <code class="calibre9">for</code> loops that loop over a range of numbers or indexes of a list, and <code class="calibre9">j</code> and <code class="calibre9">k</code> (because they come after <em class="calibre10">i</em> in the alphabet) if you have nested loops:</p>
<pre class="calibre28"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">for i in range(10</b>):
...     <b class="calibre25">for j in range(3</b>):
...         <b class="calibre25">print(i, j)</b>
...
0 0
0 1
0 2
1 0
<var class="calibre43">--snip--</var></code></pre>
<p class="calibre23">Another exception is using <code class="calibre9">x</code> and <code class="calibre9">y</code> for Cartesian coordinates. In most other cases, I caution against using single-letter variable names. Although it might be tempting to use, say, <code class="calibre9">w</code> and <code class="calibre9">h</code> as shorthand for <code class="calibre9">width</code> and <code class="calibre9">height</code>, or <code class="calibre9">n</code> as shorthand for <code class="calibre9">number</code>, these meanings might not be apparent to others. </p>

<section class="box">
<h2 class="calibre38">Dn’t Drp Lttrs Frm Yr Src Cd</h2>
<p class="boxbodyfirst">Don’t drop letters from your source code. Although dropped letters in names like <code class="calibre41">memcpy</code> (memory copy) and <code class="calibre41">strcmp</code> (string compare) were popular in the C programming language before the 1990s, they’re an unreadable style of naming that you shouldn’t use today. If a name isn’t easily pronounceable, it isn’t easily understood.</p>
<p class="calibre40">Additionally, feel free to use short phrases that can make your code read like plain English. For example, <code class="calibre41">number_of_trials</code> is more readable than simply <code class="calibre41">number_trials</code>.</p>

<h3 id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre27"><span type="pagebreak" title="63" id="calibre_link-413" class="calibre37"></span>Too Long Names</h3>
<p class="bodyfirst">In general, the larger the name’s scope, the more descriptive it should be. A short name like <code class="calibre9">payment</code> is fine for a local variable inside a single, short function. But <code class="calibre9">payment</code> might not be descriptive enough if you use it for a global variable across a 10,000-line program, because such a large program might process multiple kinds of payment data. A more descriptive name, such as <code class="calibre9">salesClientMonthlyPayment</code> or <code class="calibre9">annual_electric_bill_payment</code>, could be more suitable. The additional words in the name provide more context and resolve ambiguity.</p>
<p class="calibre23">It’s better to be overly descriptive than not descriptive enough. But there are guidelines for determining when longer names are unnecessary.</p>
<h4 id="calibre_link-746" class="calibre44">Prefixes in Names</h4>
<p class="bodyfirst">The use of common prefixes in names could indicate unnecessary detail in the name. If a variable is an attribute of a class, the prefix might provide information that doesn’t need to be in the variable name. For example, if you have a <code class="calibre9">Cat</code> class with a <code class="calibre9">weight</code> attribute, it’s obvious that <code class="calibre9">weight</code> refers to the cat’s weight. So the name <code class="calibre9">catWeight</code> would be overly descriptive and unnecessarily long.</p>
<p class="calibre23">Similarly, an old and now obsolete practice is the use of <em class="calibre10">Hungarian notation,</em> the practice of including an abbreviation of the data type in names. For example, the name <code class="calibre9">strName</code> indicates that the variable contains a string value, and <code class="calibre9">iVacationDays</code> indicates that the variable contains an integer. Modern languages and IDEs can relay this data type information to the programmer without the need for these prefixes, making Hungarian notation an unnecessary practice today. If you find you’re including the name of a data type in your names, consider removing it.</p>
<p class="calibre23">On the other hand, the <code class="calibre9">is</code> and <code class="calibre9">has</code> prefixes for variables that contain Boolean values, or functions and methods that return Boolean values, make those names more readable. Consider the following use of a variable named <code class="calibre9">is_vehicle</code> and a method named <code class="calibre9">has_key()</code>: </p>
<pre class="calibre28"><code class="calibre9"><code class="calibre42">if item_under_repair.has_key('tires'): </code>
<code class="calibre42">  is_vehicle = True</code> </code></pre>
<p class="calibre23">The <code class="calibre9">has_key()</code> method and <code class="calibre9">is_vehicle</code> variable support a plain English reading of the code: “if the item under repair has a key named ‘tires,’ then it’s true that the item is a vehicle.”</p>
<p class="calibre23">Similarly, adding units to your names can provide useful information. A <code class="calibre9">weight</code> variable that stores a floating-point value is ambiguous: is the weight in pounds, kilograms, or tons? This unit information isn’t a data type, so including a prefix or suffix of <code class="calibre9">kg</code> or <code class="calibre9">lbs</code> or <code class="calibre9">tons</code> isn’t the same as Hungarian notation. If you aren’t using a weight-specific data type that contains unit information, naming the variable something like <code class="calibre9">weight_kg</code> could be prudent. Indeed, in 1999 the Mars Climate Orbiter robotic space probe was lost when software supplied by Lockheed Martin produced calculations in imperial standard <span type="pagebreak" title="64" id="calibre_link-414" class="calibre16"></span>units, whereas NASA’s systems used metric, resulting in an incorrect trajectory. The spacecraft reportedly cost $125 million.</p>
<h4 id="calibre_link-747" class="calibre44">Sequential Numeric Suffixes in Names</h4>
<p class="bodyfirst">Sequential numeric suffixes in your names indicate that you might need to change the variable’s data type or add different details to the name. Numbers alone often don’t provide enough information to distinguish these names.</p>
<p class="calibre23">Variable names like <code class="calibre9">payment1</code>, <code class="calibre9">payment2</code>, and <code class="calibre9">payment3</code> don’t tell the person reading the code what the difference is between these payment values. The programmer should probably refactor these three variables into a single list or tuple variable named <code class="calibre9">payments</code> that contains three values.</p>
<p class="calibre23">Functions with calls like <code class="calibre9">makePayment1(amount)</code>, <code class="calibre9">makePayment2(amount)</code>, and so on should probably be refactored into a single function that accepts an integer argument: <code class="calibre9">makePayment(1, amount)</code>, <code class="calibre9">makePayment(2, amount)</code>, and so on. If these functions have different behaviors that justify separate functions, the meaning behind the numbers should be stated in the name: <code class="calibre9">makeLowPriorityPayment(amount)</code> and <code class="calibre9">makeHighPriorityPayment(amount)</code>, or <code class="calibre9">make1stQuarterPayment(amount)</code> and <code class="calibre9">make2ndQuarterPayment(amount)</code>, for example.</p>
<p class="calibre23">If you have a valid reason for choosing names with sequential numeric suffixes, it’s fine to use them. But if you’re using these names because it’s an easy choice to make, consider revising them.</p>
<h2 id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre7">Make Names Searchable</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">For all but the smallest programs, you’ll probably need to use your editor or IDE’s <span class="keycaps">Ctrl-F</span> “find” feature to locate where your variables and functions are referenced. If you choose a short, generic variable name, such as <code class="calibre9">num</code> or <code class="calibre9">a</code>, you’ll end up with several false matches. To make the name easy to find immediately, form unique names by using longer variable names that contain specific details. </p>
<p class="calibre23">Some IDEs will have refactoring features that can identify names based on how your program uses them. For example, a common feature is a “rename” tool that can differentiate between variables named <code class="calibre9">num</code> and <code class="calibre9">number</code>, as well as between local <code class="calibre9">num</code> and global <code class="calibre9">num</code> variables. But you should still choose names as though these tools weren’t available. </p>
<p class="calibre23">Keeping this rule in mind will naturally help you pick descriptive names instead of generic ones. The name <code class="calibre9">email</code> is vague, so consider a more descriptive name like <code class="calibre9">emailAddress</code>, <code class="calibre9">downloadEmailAttachment</code>, <code class="calibre9">emailMessage</code>, or <code class="calibre9">replyToAddress</code>. Not only would such a name be more precise, it would be easier to find in your source code files as well.</p>
<h2 id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre7">Avoid Jokes, Puns, and Cultural References</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">At one of my previous software jobs, our codebase contained a function named <code class="calibre9">gooseDownload()</code>. I had no idea what this meant, because the product <span type="pagebreak" title="65" id="calibre_link-415" class="calibre16"></span>we were creating had nothing to do with birds or the downloading of birds. When I found the more-senior co-worker who had originally written the function, he explained that <em class="calibre10">goose</em> was meant as a verb, as in “goose the engine.” I had no idea what this phrase meant, either. He had to further explain that “goose the engine” was automotive jargon that meant press down on the gas pedal to make the engine go faster. Thus, <code class="calibre9">gooseDownload()</code> was a function to make downloads go faster. I nodded my head and went back to my desk. Years later, after this co-worker left the company, I renamed his function to <code class="calibre9">increaseDownloadSpeed()</code>.</p>
<p class="calibre23">When choosing names in your program, you might be tempted to use jokes, puns, or cultural references to add some levity to your code. Don’t do this. Jokes can be hard to convey in text, and the joke probably won’t be as funny in the future. Puns can also be easy to miss, and handling repeat bug reports from co-workers who confused a pun for a typo can be quite punishing.</p>
<p class="calibre23">Culture-specific references can get in the way of communicating your code’s intent clearly. The internet makes it easier than ever to share source code with strangers around the world who won’t necessarily be fluent in English or understand English jokes. As noted earlier in the chapter, the names <code class="calibre9">spam</code>, <code class="calibre9">eggs</code>, and <code class="calibre9">bacon</code> used in Python documentation reference a Monty Python comedy sketch, but we use these as metasyntactic variables only; it’s inadvisable to use them in real-world code. </p>
<p class="calibre23">The best policy is to write your code in a way that non-native English speakers can readily understand: polite, direct, and humorless. My former co-worker might have thought <code class="calibre9">gooseDownload()</code> was a funny joke, but nothing kills a joke faster than having to explain it.</p>
<h2 id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre7">Don’t Overwrite Built-in Names</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">You should also never use Python’s built-in names for your own variables. For example, if you name a variable <code class="calibre9">list</code> or <code class="calibre9">set</code>, you’ll overwrite Python’s <code class="calibre9">list()</code> and <code class="calibre9">set()</code> functions, possibly causing bugs later in your code. The <code class="calibre9">list()</code> function creates list objects. But overwriting it can lead to this error:</p>
<pre class="calibre28"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">list(range(5))</b>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
<span class="codeannotationhang">1</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">list = ['cat', 'dog', 'moose']</b>
<span class="codeannotationhang">2</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">list(range(5))</b>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'list' object is not callable</code></pre>
<p class="calibre23">If we assign a list value to the name <code class="calibre9">list</code><span class="codeannotation">1</span>, we’ll lose the original <code class="calibre9">list()</code> function. Attempting to call <code class="calibre9">list()</code><span class="codeannotation">2</span> would result in a <code class="calibre9">TypeError</code>. To find out whether Python is already using a name, type it into the interactive shell or try to import it. You’ll get a <code class="calibre9">NameError</code> or <code class="calibre9">ModuleNotFoundError</code> if the name isn’t <span type="pagebreak" title="66" id="calibre_link-416" class="calibre16"></span>being used. For example, Python uses the names <code class="calibre9">open</code> and <code class="calibre9">test</code> but doesn’t use <code class="calibre9">spam</code> and <code class="calibre9">eggs</code>:</p>
<pre class="calibre28"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">open </b>
&lt;built-in function open &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">import test</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">spam </b>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'spam' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">import eggs </b>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'eggs'</code></pre>
<p class="calibre23">Some commonly overwritten Python names are <code class="calibre9">all</code>, <code class="calibre9">any</code>, <code class="calibre9">date</code>, <code class="calibre9">email</code>, <code class="calibre9">file</code>, <code class="calibre9">format</code>, <code class="calibre9">hash</code>, <code class="calibre9">id</code>, <code class="calibre9">input</code>, <code class="calibre9">list</code>, <code class="calibre9">min</code>, <code class="calibre9">max</code>, <code class="calibre9">object</code>, <code class="calibre9">open</code>, <code class="calibre9">random</code>, <code class="calibre9">set</code>, <code class="calibre9">str</code>, <code class="calibre9">sum</code>, <code class="calibre9">test</code>, and <code class="calibre9">type</code>. Don’t use these names for your identifiers.</p>
<p class="calibre23">Another common problem is naming your <em class="calibre10">.py</em> files the same names as third-party modules. For example, if you installed the third-party Pyperclip module but also created a <em class="calibre10">pyperclip.py</em> file, an <code class="calibre9">import pyperclip</code> statement imports <em class="calibre10">pyperclip.py</em> instead of the Pyperclip module. When you try to call Pyperclip’s <code class="calibre9">copy()</code> or <code class="calibre9">paste()</code> functions, you’ll get an error saying they don’t exist:</p>
<pre class="calibre28"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; # Run this code with a file named pyperclip.py in the current folder.
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">import pyperclip</b> # This imports your pyperclip.py, not the real one.
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre25">pyperclip.copy('hello')</b>

<h2 id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre7">The Worst Possible Variable Names Ever</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">The name <code class="calibre9">data</code> is a terrible, generic variable name, because literally all variables contain data. The same goes for naming variables <code class="calibre9">var</code>, which is a bit like naming your pet dog “Dog.” The name <code class="calibre9">temp</code> is common for variables that temporarily hold data but is still a poor choice: after all, from a Zen perspective, all variables are temporary. Unfortunately, these names occur frequently despite their vagueness; avoid using them in your code.</p>
<p class="calibre23">If you need a variable to hold the statistical variance of your temperature data, please use the name <code class="calibre9">temperatureVariance</code>. It should go without saying that the name <code class="calibre9">tempVarData</code> would be a poor choice.</p>
<h2 id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre7"><span type="pagebreak" title="67" id="calibre_link-417" class="calibre20"></span>Summary</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">Choosing names has nothing to do with algorithms or computer science, and yet it’s a vital part of writing readable code. Ultimately, the names you use in your code are up to you, but be aware of the many guidelines that exist. The PEP 8 document recommends several naming conventions, such as lowercase names for modules and <code class="calibre9">PascalCase</code> names for classes. Names shouldn’t be too short or too long. But it’s often better to err on the side of too descriptive instead of not detailed enough.</p>
<p class="calibre23">A name should be concise but descriptive. A name that is easy to find using a <span class="keycaps">Ctrl-F</span> search feature is the sign of a distinct and descriptive variable. Think about how searchable your name is to determine whether you’re using a too generic name. Also, consider whether a programmer who doesn’t speak fluent English would understand the name: avoid using jokes, puns, and cultural references in your names; instead, choose names that are polite, direct, and humorless. </p>
<p class="calibre23">Although many of the suggestions in this chapter are simply guidelines, you should always avoid names Python’s standard library already uses, such as <code class="calibre9">all</code>, <code class="calibre9">any</code>, <code class="calibre9">date</code>, <code class="calibre9">email</code>, <code class="calibre9">file</code>, <code class="calibre9">format</code>, <code class="calibre9">hash</code>, <code class="calibre9">id</code>, <code class="calibre9">input</code>, <code class="calibre9">list</code>, <code class="calibre9">min</code>, <code class="calibre9">max</code>, <code class="calibre9">object</code>, <code class="calibre9">open</code>, <code class="calibre9">random</code>, <code class="calibre9">set</code>, <code class="calibre9">str</code>, <code class="calibre9">sum</code>, <code class="calibre9">test</code>, and <code class="calibre9">type</code>. Using these names could cause subtle bugs in your code.</p>
<p class="calibre23">The computer doesn’t care whether your names are descriptive or vague. Names make code easier to read by humans, not easier to run by computers. If your code is readable, it’s easy to understand. If it’s easy to understand, it’s easy to change. And if it’s easy to change, it’s easier to fix bugs or add new features. Using understandable names is a foundational step to producing quality software.</p>
