<h1><a name="_Toc115418677"></a><a name="_Toc115359988">Exercise #8: Read Write
File</a></h1>
<p class="ChapterTitleCodeExample"><img border="0" height="144" id="Picture 19" src="../images/image009.jpg" width="120"/></p>
<p class="Body">File I/O, or file input/output, allows your programs to read and
write data to files on the hard drive. This exercise covers just the basics of
writing text to a file with Python code and then reading the text from the file
you just created. File I/O is an important technique because it allows your
programs to save data so that work isn’t lost when the program closes.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Exercise Description</p>
<p class="Body">You will write three functions for this exercise. First, write a <span class="Literal">writeToFile()</span> function with two parameters for the
filename of the file and the text to write into the file. Second, write an <span class="Literal">appendToFile()</span> function, which is identical to <span class="Literal">writeToFile()</span> except that the file opens in append mode
instead of write mode. Finally, write a <code>readFromFile()</code>
function with one parameter for the filename to open. This function returns the
full text contents of the file as a string.</p>
<p class="Body">These Python instructions should generate the file and the <span class="Literal">assert</span> statement checks that the content is correct:</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpFirst">writeToFile('greet.txt', 'Hello!\n')</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">appendToFile('greet.txt', 'Goodbye!\n')</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpLast">assert readFromFile('greet.txt') == 'Hello!\nGoodbye!\n'</p>
<p class="Body">This code writes the text <code>'Hello!\n'</code>
and <code>'Goodbye!\n'</code> to a file named <span class="Italic"><span style='font-family:"serif"'>greet.txt</span></span>, then reads in
this file’s content to verify it is correct. You can delete the <span class="Italic"><span style='font-family:"serif"'>greet.txt</span></span>
file after running these instructions program.</p>
<p class="Body">Try to write a solution based on the information in this
description. If you still have trouble solving this exercise, read the <span class="Bold">Solution Design</span> and <span class="Bold">Special Cases and
Gotchas</span> sections for additional hints.</p>
<p class="Body">Prerequisite concepts: text file reading and writing</p>
<p class="HeadA">Solution Design</p>
<p class="Body">Python’s built-in <code>open()</code> function returns
a file object that you can use to read or write text from and to the file. You
should call <code>open()</code> with the <code>with</code>
statement, like <code>with open(filename, mode) as fileObj:</code>.</p>
<p class="Body">The valid arguments for the <code>mode</code> parameter
are <code>'r'</code> to read from text files, <span class="Literal">'w'</span> to write to text files, and <code>'a'</code>
to append (that is, write at the end of) to text files. If no mode argument is
given, then the function defaults to read mode. Opening the file in write or
append mode lets you call <code>fileObj.write('text goes here')</code>,
which allows you to pass a string of text to write to the file. Otherwise, in
read mode calling <code>fileObj.read()</code> returns the file’s contents
as a string.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Special Cases and Gotchas</p>
<p class="Body">If you open a file in write mode and the file doesn’t exist, then
a blank file is created. If the file does exist, it is overwritten with a blank
file. Append mode, as opposed to write mode, adds text to the end of the file
without destroying the original content.</p>
<p class="Body">Now try to write a solution based on the information in the
previous sections. If you still have trouble solving this exercise, read the <span class="Bold">Solution Template</span> section for additional hints.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Solution Template</p>
<p class="Body">Try to first write a solution from scratch. But if you have
difficulty, you can use the following partial program as a starting place. Copy
the following code from <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://invpy.com/readwritefile-template.py</span>
and paste it into your code editor. Replace the underscores with code to make a
working program:</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpFirst">def writeToFile(filename, text):</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">    <span class="CodeComment"># Open the file in write
mode:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">    with open(filename, ____) as fileObj:</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">        <span class="CodeComment"># Write the text to the
file:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">        ____.write(text)</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle"> </p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">def appendToFile(filename, text):</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">    <span class="CodeComment"># Open the file in append
mode:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">    ____ open(filename, ____) as fileObj:</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">        <span class="CodeComment"># Write the text to the
end of the file:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">        ____.write(____)</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle"> </p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">def readFromFile(filename):</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">    <span class="CodeComment"># Open the file in read
mode:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">    ____ ____(filename) as fileObj:</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">        <span class="CodeComment"># Read all of the text
in the file and return it as a string:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpLast">        return ____.read()</p>
<p class="Body">The complete solution for this exercise is given in Appendix A
and <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://invpy.com/readwritefile.py</span>. You can
view each step of this program as it runs under a debugger at <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://invpy.com/readwritefile-debug/</span>.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Further Reading</p>
<p class="Body">You can learn about reading and writing files in Chapters 9 and
10 of my book, <span class="Italic"><span style='font-family:"serif"'>Automate
the Boring Stuff with Python</span></span> online at <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/</span>.</p>
