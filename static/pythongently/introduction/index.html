<p class=ChapterTitleCodeExample>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body>“How can I get better at programming?” I see this common question
often from those who have started their programming journey. Of course, there
are plenty of Python programming tutorials for total beginners. However, these
tutorials can carry the reader so far. After finishing these lessons, readers often
find their skills more than capable for yet another “Hello, world!” tutorial
but not advanced enough to begin writing their own programs. They find
themselves in the so-called “tutorial hell.” They learn the basic syntax of a
programming language, but wonder where to begin when it comes to applying them
to their own programs.</p>

<p class=Body>Programming is like any other skill: it gets better with
practice. I’ve chosen the exercises in this book because they are short and straightforward.
Each exercise involves only a handful of programming concepts and you can solve
them in a single session at the computer. If you’ve been intimidated by
“competitive programming” or “hacker challenge” websites, you’ll find these to
be an instructive and gentler way to level up your coding skills.</p>

<p class=Body>When I wrote <span class=Italic><span style='font-family:"serif"'>Automate
the Boring Stuff with Python</span></span>, I wanted to teach programming to as
many non-programmers as possible. So, I released that book (and all of my other
programming books) under a Creative Commons license so they could be downloaded
and shared for free from my website <span class=MsoHyperlink>https://inventwithpython.com</span>.
You can pay for a physical print book but it’s important to me to lower all
barriers to access, so the books are available online for free. I’ll cite some
of these books in the <b>Further Reading</b> section of the
exercises in this book.</p>

<p class=HeadA>What Will This Book Do For You?</p>

<p class=Body>This book offers 42 programming exercises for inexperienced Python
programmers. I’ve gathered them into this book and combined them with plain-English
explanations. You can read the description for each exercise and start on the
solution immediately. If you need further help, you can read about the
programming concepts you’ll need to know for the solution. You can also find
out about any surprising “gotchas” you might encounter while writing your
solution. Finally, if you still need help, I provide a fill-in-the-blank
template of the solution. Try to resist the temptation to immediately jump to
the hints; try to solve these exercises yourself first.</p>

<p class=Body>As you work through these exercises, you’ll find that some use
the same coding techniques as other problems. A lot of programming expertise develops
this way: being able to solve a problem isn’t about how smart you are but if
you’ve seen similar problems before. My aim isn’t to stump you with complex,
contrived programming challenges but help you explore simple problems with
gentle explanations.</p>

<p class=HeadA>Prerequisites</p>

<p class=Body>While this isn’t a book to teach programming to complete
beginners, you don’t need to be a programming expert before tackling the
challenges here. Any beginner’s resource, such as one of my free books, <span
class=Italic><span style='font-family:"serif"'>Automate the Boring
Stuff with Python</span></span> or <span class=Italic><span style='font-family:
"serif"'>Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</span></span>, is
more than enough to prepare you for these exercises. You can find these books for
free at <span class=MsoHyperlink>https://inventwithpython.com</span>. I also
recommend <span class=Italic><span style='font-family:"serif"'>Python
Crash Course</span></span> by Eric Matthes as an excellent book for people with
no programming experience. These books are published by No Starch Press, which
has an extensive library of high-quality Python books at <span
class=MsoHyperlink>https://nostarch.com/catalog/python</span>.</p>

<p class=Body>To solve the exercises in this book, you should already know, or
at least be familiar with, the following Python programming concepts:</p>

<p class=Body>You don’t need a mastery of classes and object-oriented
programming. You don’t need to know advanced concepts such as machine learning
or data science. But if you’d like to eventually build your skills to advanced
topics like these, this book can help you start along that path.</p>

<p class=Body>Even if you’ve moved past the beginner stage, this book can help
you assess your programming ability. By the time you’re ready to start applying
to junior software developer positions, you should be able to solve all of the
exercises in this book easily.</p>

<p class=HeadA>About the Exercises</p>

<p class=Body>The exercises are generally ordered from least to most difficult.
But you don’t have to solve them in order, so feel free to jump around to any
exercises that you find interesting.</p>

<p class=Body>Each exercise has the following sections:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Exercise Description</b> – A description of
the exercise, followed by a list of <code>assert</code>
statements that specify the results it expects from your solution program. There
is also a list of prerequisite concepts you’ll need to understand to solve this
exercise. If you don’t understand any of them, you can do an internet search of
these terms along with “Python” to find explanations of them. This is the only
section you need to read to solve the exercise. The later sections provide additional
hints if you need them.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Solution Design</b> – Additional information
about concepts you’ll need to know to write a solution, along with a brief,
gentle explanation of them.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Special Cases and Gotchas</b> – Describes
common mistakes or surprising “gotchas” you may encounter when writing code for
the solution. Some exercises have special cases that your solution will need to
address.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Solution Template</b> – A copy of my own
solution for the exercise, with selected parts replaced by blanks for you to
fill in. Your solution can still be correct if it doesn’t match mine. But if
you’re having trouble knowing where to start with your program, these templates
provide some but not all of the solution code.</p>

<p class=Body>Many solution programs to the exercises in this book are only a
few lines of code long, and none of them are longer than 50 lines. If you find
yourself writing several hundred lines of code, you’re probably overthinking
the solution and should probably read the <b>Exercise Description</b>
section again.</p>

<p class=Body>Each exercise has several <code>assert</code>
statements that detail the expected results from your solution. In Python, <span
class=Literal>assert</span> statements are the <code>assert</code>
keyword followed by a condition. They stop the program with an <span
class=Literal>AssertionError</span> if their condition is <code>False</code>.
They are a basic sanity check and, for this book, tell you the expected
behavior of your solution. For example, Exercise #3, “Odd &amp; Even” has assert
<code>isOdd(9999) == True</code>, which tells you that the
correct solution involves the <code>isOdd()</code> function
returning <code>True</code> when passed an argument of <span
class=Literal>9999</span>. Examine all of the <code>assert</code>
statements for an exercise before writing your solution program.</p>

<p class=Body>Some exercises don’t have <code>assert</code>
statements, but rather show you the output that your solution should produce.
You can compare this output to your solution’s output to verify that your
solution is correct.</p>

<p class=Body>I provide complete solutions in Appendix A. But there are many
ways to solve any given programming problem. You don’t need to produce an
identical copy of my solutions; it just needs to pass the <code>assert</code>
statements. I wrote my solutions to be conceptually simple and easy for the
intended audience of this book to understand. They produce correct results but aren’t
necessarily the fastest or most efficient solutions. As you get more experience
programming, you can revisit the exercises in this book and attempt to write
high-performance solutions to them.</p>

<span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"sans-serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Minion Pro","serif";
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Body>Most of the solutions involve writing functions that return
values based on the arguments passed to the function call. In these cases, you
can write your code assuming that the arguments are always of the expected data
type. So for example, if your function expects an integer, it will have to
handle arguments like <code>42</code>, <code>0</code>,
or <code>-3</code> but doesn’t have to handle arguments like <span
class=Literal>3.14</span> or <code>'hello'</code>.</p>

<p class=Body>Keep in mind that there is a difference between a <span
class=Italic><span style='font-family:"serif"'>parameter</span></span>
and an <i>argument</i>.
When we <i>define</i>
a function such as Exercise #3’s <code>def isOdd(number):</code>,
the local variable <code>number</code> is a <span class=Italic><span
style='font-family:"serif"'>parameter</span></span>. When we call
this function with <code>isOdd(42)</code>, the integer <span
class=Literal>42</span> is an <i>argument</i>.
The argument is passed to the function and assigned as the value to the parameter.
It’s easy to use “parameter” and “argument” interchangeably, but this book uses
them in their correct technical sense.</p>

<p class=Body>Python is a practical language with many helpful functions in its
standard library. Some exercises will explicitly forbid you from using these
functions. For example, Exercise #34, “Uppercase Letters” tasks you to write code
to convert a string to uppercase letters. Using Python’s built-in <span
class=Literal>upper()</span> string method to do this for you would defeat the
purpose of the exercise, so the <b>Exercise Description</b> section
points out that your solution shouldn’t call it.</p>

<p class=Body>I recommend solving the exercises in this book repeatedly until
it becomes effortless. If you can solve an exercise once, try solving it again
a couple of weeks later or without looking at the hints in the later sections.
After a while, you’ll find yourself quickly being able to come up with
strategies to solve these exercises.</p>
