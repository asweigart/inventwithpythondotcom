<p class="Body"> “Hello, world!” is a common first program to write when learning
any programming language. It makes the text “Hello, world!” appear on the
screen. While not much of a program, it serves as a simple test for whether the
programmer has the language interpreter correctly installed, the computer environment
set up, and a basic understanding of how to write a complete program.</p>
<p class="Body">This exercise adds an additional step to collect keyboard input
from the user. You’ll also need to concatenate (that is, join together) string
values to greet the user by name. The exercises in this book are for those with
some experience writing programs, so if this exercise is currently beyond your
skill level, I’d recommend reading some of the beginner resources I discussed
in the <b>Prerequisites</b> section of the Introduction.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Exercise Description</p>
<p class="Body">Write a program that, when run, greets the user by printing
“Hello, world!” on the screen. Then it prints a message on the screen asking
the user to enter their name. The program greets the user by name by printing
the “Hello,” followed by the user’s name.</p>
<p class="Body">Let’s use “Alice” as the example name. Your program’s output should
look like this:</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpFirst">Hello, world!</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">What is your name?</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle"><b>Alice</b></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpLast">Hello, Alice</p>
<p class="Body">Try to write a solution based on the information in this
description. If you still have trouble solving this exercise, read the <span class="Bold">Solution Design</span> and <span class="Bold">Special Cases and
Gotchas</span> sections for additional hints.</p>
<p class="Body">Prerequisite concepts: <code>print()</code>,
strings, string concatenation</p>
<p class="HeadA">Solution Design</p>
<p class="Body">There is no surprising design to the solution. It is a straightforward
four-line program:</p>
<p class="Body" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      </span>Print
the text, “Hello, world!”</p>
<p class="Body" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      </span>Print
the text, “What is your name?”</p>
<p class="Body" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      </span>Let
the user enter their name and store this in a variable.</p>
<p class="Body" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      </span>Print
the text “Hello,” followed by their name. </p>
<p class="Body">The program calls Python’s <code>print()</code>
function to display string values on the screen. As always, the quotes of the
string aren’t displayed on the screen because those aren’t part of the string
value’s text, but rather mark where the string begins and ends in the source
code of the program. The program calls Python’s <code>input()</code>
function to get the user input from the keyboard and stores this in a variable.</p>
<p class="Body">The <code>+</code> operator is used to add numeric
values like integers or floating-point numbers together, but it can also create
a new string value from the concatenation of two other string values.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Special Cases and Gotchas</p>
<p class="Body">Make sure that there is a space before printing the user’s name. If
the user entered “Alice”, the program should print <span class="Literal">'Hello,
Alice'</span> and not <code>'Hello,Alice'</code>.</p>
<p class="Body">Now try to write a solution based on the information in the
previous sections. If you still have trouble solving this exercise, read the <span class="Bold">Solution Template</span> section for additional hints.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Solution Template</p>
<p class="Body">Try to first write a solution from scratch, But if you have
difficulty, you can use the following partial program as a starting place. Copy
the following code from <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://invpy.com/helloworld-template.py</span>
and paste it into your code editor. Replace the underscores with code to make a
working program:</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpFirst"><span class="CodeComment"># Print "Hello,
world!" on the screen:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">____('Hello, world!')</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle"><span class="CodeComment"># Ask the user for their name:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">____('What is your name?')</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle"><span class="CodeComment"># Get the user's name from
their keyboard input:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle">name = ____()</p>
<p class="CodeCxSpMiddle"><span class="CodeComment"># Greet the user by their name:</span></p>
<p class="CodeCxSpLast">print('Hello, ' + ____)</p>
<p class="Body">The complete solution for this exercise is given in Appendix A
and <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://invpy.com/helloworld.py</span>. You can
view each step of this program as it runs under a debugger at <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://invpy.com/helloworld-debug/</span>.</p>
<p class="HeadA">Further Reading</p>
<p class="Body">A “Hello, world!” program is a good target program to create when
learning a new programming language. Most languages have a concept of <span class="Definition">standard streams</span> for text-based, command-line programs.
These programs have a stream of input text and a stream of output text. The
stream of output text the program produces appears on the screen (via <span class="Literal">print()</span> in Python). The stream of input text the program
accepts comes from the keyboard (via <code>input()</code> in
Python). The main benefit of streams is that you can redirect them: the text
output can go to a file instead of the screen, or a program’s input can come
from the output of another program instead of the keyboard. You can learn more
about the <span class="Italic"><span style='font-family:"serif"'>command-line
interface</span></span>, also called <span class="Italic"><span style='font-family:
"serif"'>terminal windows</span></span>, in the free book “Beyond
the Basic Stuff with Python” at <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/</span>.
Command-line programs tend to be simpler than graphical programs, and you can
find nearly a hundred such programs in the free book, <span class="Italic"><span style='font-family:"serif"'>The Big Book of Small Python Projects</span></span>
at <span class="MsoHyperlink">https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/</span>.</p>
