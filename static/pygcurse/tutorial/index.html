<h1>The Pygcurse Tutorial</h1>
<p>Pygcurse requires Pygame to be installed. Pygame can be
downloaded from <a href="http://pygame.org">http://pygame.org</a></p>
<blockquote>This tutorial is designed for Python 3. If you have
Python 2
installed, the differences will be noted in blue boxes like these. The
same pygcurse.py file can be used with either version.</blockquote>
It
should be noted that Pygcurse handles unicode as well as
Pygame&nbsp;and your selected font handles unicode. If it cannot
display a character, it shows a rectangle box. (I've run into some
issues with the extended characters, but these seem to by Pygame
issues.)
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Let's
Make a "Hello World" Program with Pygcurse</h2>
<p>Using the Pygcurse module is super easy. Here's a simple
"Hello World" program.</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(40, 25, 'Hello World Program')<br>win.pygprint('Hello world!')<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()</pre>
<p>The
first line imports the Pygcurse module. The second line creates a
PygcurseWindow object that has 40 columns and 25 rows, (resulting in 40
x 25 = 1000 character positions, which are called "cells") and "Hello
World
Program" as the window's caption in the title bar. The third line
prints out the text "Hello world!" and then the fourth line waits for
the user to press a key before terminating the program. (Without this
last line, the program would immediately quit right after printing the
"Hello world!" string and you wouldn't have time to see it.</p>
<p>The reason the method is named pygprint() instead of print()
is that print is a keyword in Python 2. To make your code compatible
with both Python 2 and 3, Pygcurse could not make the method named
print().</p>
<h2>The input() Method</h2>
<p>Let's do another simple program that mimics basic Python text
programs:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(40, 25)<br>win.pygprint('What is your name?')<br>name = win.input()<br>win.write('Hello, ')<br>win.fgcolor = 'red'<br>win.write(name + '!\n')<br>win.colors = ('red', 'green')<br>win.pygprint('It is good to meet you!')<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br></pre>
<p><img style="width: 536px; height: 363px;" alt="" src="pygtut_color.png"></p>
<p>Notice that the PygcurseWindow object also has an input()
method, which works similar to Python's input() function.</p>
<p>Pygcurse for Python 2 and 3 have a method called raw_input()
that is the exact same as the input() method, if you prefer using that
name,</p>
<p>There is also a write() method, which behaves similar to the
sys.stdout.write() function.
(That is, it prints without the newline character at the end.) Notice
how you can change the foreground color by setting the fgcolor
attribute to the string 'red'. The bgcolor attribute works the same way
for the background color. If you want to set both in one line, set the
colors attribute to a tuple (the foreground color first, then the
background color)</p>
<h2>Color Values in Pygcurse</h2>
<p>Along with the
fgcolor, bgcolor, and colors attributes, several of the PygcurseWindow
methods take fgcolor and bgcolor keyword arguments. For example, you
can call win.write('Hello world', fgcolor='blue', bgcolor='green') to
print the string with blue text on a green background. This doesn't
change the colors that the PygcurseWindow is set to like setting the
fgcolor and bgcolor attributes. It only applies for the one function
call.</p>
<p>The full list of color strings is found in the
pygcurse.colornames dict, which has keys of strings and values of
pygame.Color objects. They are:</p>
<pre>'white'<br>'yellow'<br>'fuchsia'<br>'red'<br>'silver'<br>'gray'<br>'olive'<br>'purple'<br>'maroon'<br>'aqua'<br>'lime'<br>'teal'<br>'green'<br>'blue'<br>'navy'<br>'black'</pre>
<p>If you wish to use other color strings, you can add them to
the pygcurse.colornames dictionary.</p>
<p>Also, you can use pygame.Color objects directly, such as
win.write('Hello world', fgcolor=pygame.Color(255, 0, 0))</p>
<p>Finally,
you can also simply pass a tuple of three (or four, if you want to
specify an alpha value) integers of 0 to 255 to specify the color:
win.write('Hello world', fgcolor=(255, 0, 0))</p>
<p>Any of these three
formats can be used. (They are all converted to pygame.Color objects by
the pygcurse.getPygameColor() function.)</p>
<p>Take a look at this sample program and its output:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(40, 25)<br>for k in pygcurse.colornames:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win.write('This is the color %s\n' % (k), fgcolor=k)<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()</pre>
<p><img style="width: 536px; height: 363px;" alt="" src="pygtut_allcolors.png"></p>
<h2>Moving the Cursor</h2>
<p>Whenever
you call the pygprint() or write() methods, the text appears where the
screen cursor is. The cursor starts at cell 0, 0 (in the top left
corner of the screen) and is set to the first cell after the printed
text. However, you can also set the cursor position directly:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(40, 25)<br>win.cursor = (20, 10)<br>win.write('Hello world!')<br>win.cursory = 11<br>win.write('Howdy!')<br>win.write('Ohiyo gozaimasu!', x=20, y=12)<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br></pre>
<p><img style="width: 536px; height: 363px;" alt="" src="pygtut_cursor.png"></p>
<p>By moving the cursor, you can tell
Pygcurse where to output your text. The pygprint(), write() and
putchars()
methods also all have x and y keyword arguments that can dictate where
the text for those calls should start.</p>
<p>Occasionally you might want to save the current position of
the cursor and restore it later. You can call the pushcursor() and
popcursor() methods to save and restore the current cursor position
respectively.</p>
<h2>pygprint() vs. write() vs putchars()</h2>
<p>There are a few different PygcurseWindow methods for
displaying text. The differences between them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments
- pygprint() (in Python 3) has a sep and end keyword argument (this
does not exist when Pygcurse is run on Python 2). The pygprint() method
can also take
multiple strings to print (just like print statement in Python 2 and
the print() function in Python 3), while
write() and putchars() can only take one string (and it must be a
string value, no type casting is done)</li>
<li>Modifies Cursor - The
pyprint() and write() methods set the cursor to the position after the
last character they display. The putchars() method does not affect the
screen cursor.</li>
<li>Colors - The pygprint() and write() methods, if no
fgcolor or bgcolor argument is specified, will change the cells that
they print text to to the PygcurseWindow object's current foreground
and background colors. However, the putchars() method, if no fgcolor or
bgcolor argument is specified, will reuse whatever the cell's current
foreground and background colors are. (In other words, putchars() only
prints text to the screen, it does not print the foreground/background
color.)</li>
<li>Purpose
- The pygprint() method is there to provide an analog to Python 3's
normal
print() function (and Python 2's print statement). The write() method
is there so that the
PygcurseWindow object can be treated like as a file-like object. The
putchars() method is there so that text can be displayed without
modifying the cursor.</li>
<li>Indentation - The putchars() method wraps
text to the column it started printing, rather than to the beginning of
the row. This can be disabled by setting the "indent" keyword argument
to False. Consider the following short program:</li>
</ul>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.putchars('Hello world!', x=16, y=2, indent=True)<br>win.putchars('Hello world!', x=16, y=6)<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()</pre>
<img style="width: 276px; height: 168px;" alt="" src="pygtut_indent.png">
<h2>region Keyword Arguments in Pygcurse</h2>
<p>Several of the methods in Pygcurse affect an area of the
screen. For example, the fill() method fills up every cell of the
PygcurseWindow object with a certain character, foreground color, and
background color:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.fill('$', fgcolor='yellow', bgcolor='blue')<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()</pre>
<img style="width: 276px; height: 168px;" alt="" src="pygtut_fill.png">
<p>However,
you may not want to fill the entire screen up like this. You might only
want to fill a portion of the screen. The fill() method (and several
other methods in Pygcurse) has a "region" keyword arguments that let
you do
this. By default, region is set to None unless you specify otherwise.
Here is how it is
interpretted:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the region is None, then the entire surface is selected.</li>
<li>If region is set to a tuple of four integers, then the
integers are interpretted as (x, y, width, height).</li>
<li>If region is a four-integer tuple, if width or height are
set to
None, then the width/height are set to be long enough to reach the
right/bottom edge of the surface.</li>
<li>Region can also be set to a pygame.Rect object.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The None Value in Pygcurse</h2>
Whenever
a method has None passed for a Pygcurse method's arguments, this
usually means "use whatever default value is already there." For
example, passing None for an fgcolor or bgcolor parameter will result
in no color changes. The color used will just be whatever color that
cell is currently set to.
<h2>Tint, Light, and Shadow</h2>
<p>Each cell
has a set foreground and background color. However, in addition it can
also have a tint. A tint is a three-tuple of integers from -255 to 255
which is added to the existing RGB color of the foreground and
background colors. A tint of (0, 0, 0) is completely clear and does not
affect the cell's color (this is the default tint of every cell to
begin with). A tint of (50, 0, 0) adds 50 to the Red value of the
cell's displayed foreground and background color (the actual foreground
and background color setting of the cell is not changed.)</p>
<p>Shadow
and lighting effects can be made by using the same value for each of
the three values (red, green, and blue). For example, a tint of (-50,
-50, -50) will darken the color, making it look like it is shaded. Look
at this program for an example:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.colors = ('lime', 'gray')<br>win.write('Hello world!' * 30)<br>win.settint(50, 0, 0, (1, 1, 2, 2))<br>win.settint(255, 0, 0, (3, 1, 2, 2))<br>win.settint(-100, -100, -100, (10, 5, 5, 5))<br>win.settint(-255, -255, -255, (1, 4, 3, 3))<br>win.settint(255, 255, 255, (5, 4, 3, 3))<br>win.update()<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br></pre>
<p><img style="width: 276px; height: 168px;" alt="" src="pygtut_tint.png"></p>
<p>Remember, the tint does not affect the fgcolor or bgcolor
value of a particular cell. It only affects the displayed color.</p>
There
are several methods that are used to change the tint. They all take
XYWHR arguments to specify the area of cells that they affect.
<ul>
<li>settint(r, g, b) - This directly sets the red, green, and
blue tint to a value between -255 and 255.</li>
<li>tint(r, g, b) - This modifies the existing tint by adding
the r, g, and b parameters to the existing tint value.</li>
<li>darken(amount) - This uniformly darkens the cells. The
amount argument is between 0 (no darkening) and 255 (completely black).</li>
<li>lighten(amount) - This uniformly lightens the cells. The
amount argument is between 0 (no lightening) and 255 (completely white).</li>
<li>setbrightness(amount)
- This does the same thing as settint(), except that all three of the
RGB tints are set to the amount argument.</li>
<li>addshadow(amount, offset, direction, xoffset, yoffset) -
Explained below.</li>
</ul>
The addshadow() method creates a shadow by darkening the cells around a
rectangular region. For example, look at this program:
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.colors = ('aqua', 'gray')<br>win.fill('x')<br>win.fgcolor = 'lime'<br>win.fill('#', region=(4, 2, 5, 5))<br>win.addshadow(region=(4, 2, 5, 5))<br>win.update()<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br></pre>
<p><img style="width: 276px; height: 168px;" alt="" src="pygtut_shadow1.png"></p>
<p>The addshadow() method has several keyword arguments for
customizing the shadow. For example, the amount keyword argument can be
set to an integer from -255 to 255. (This is identical to the amount
keyword argument for the darken() method.)
The offset keyword argument can change how far away the shadow is. For
example, if we changed the&nbsp;addshadow() call in the previousto
this: </p>
<pre>win.addshadow(amount=200, offset=2, region=(4, 2, 5, 5))</pre>
<p>Then this is what it would look like:</p>
<img style="width: 276px; height: 168px;" alt="" src="pygtut_shadow2.png">
<p>The
direction keyword argument changes where the shadow is cast. By default
it is set to pygcurse.SOUTHEAST. The pygcurse module has constant
variables for all eight directions:NORTH, NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, WEST,
EAST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, SOUTHEAST. </p>
<p>Normally the amount the shadow is offset is equal in the x and
y directions. However,&nbsp;the xoffset and yoffset&nbsp;will
override the direction and offset keyword arguments. Remember that a
positive offset moves to the right and down, while a negative offset
moves to the left and up.</p>
<h2>Cell Coordinates and Pixel Coordinates</h2>
<p>There
are two Cartesian coordinate systems for Pygcurse programs: the cell
coordinates (used for text characters) and the pixel coordinates (used
for pixels). They both have their 0, 0 origin start in the upper left
corner of the window, and have their X axis increase going right and Y
axis increase going down. In Pygcurse, coordinates/width/height refers
to the cell coordinates. If they refer to pixel coordinates, they are
called "pixelwidth" or "pixelx", etc. Here are the PygcurseWindow
attributes that track different measurements:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 556px; height: 116px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">PygcurseWindow
Attribute</td>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>width &amp; height</td>
<td>The number of cells wide and tall the window is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>size</td>
<td>Tuple of two integers: (width, height)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pixelwidth &amp; pixelheight</td>
<td>The number of pixels wide and tall the window is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pixelsize</td>
<td>Tuple of two integers: (pixelwidth, pixelheight)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cellwidth &amp; cellheight</td>
<td>The number of pixels wide and tall each cell is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cellsize</td>
<td>Tuple of two integers: (cellwidth, cellheight)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(Currently the cellwidth. cellheight, and cellsize attributes
are read-only.)</p>
<p>The obvious equation to convert between the two systems is
cellx = int(pixelx / cellwidth)
and pixelx = cellx * cellwidth. But to make it easy, there are also
PygcurseWindow methods to do these conversions and a few other helpful
things:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 928px; height: 116px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">PygcurseWindow Method</td>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gettopleftpixel(cellx, celly, withinBoundaries=True)</td>
<td>Returns a tuple (x, y) of the pixel coordinates for the
cell's top left pixel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gettoppixel(celly, withinBoundaries=True)</td>
<td>Returns the Y pixel coordinate of the cell's top left
pixel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>getleftpixel(cellx, withinBoundaries=True)</td>
<td>Returns the X pixel coordinate of the cell's top left
pixel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>getcoordinatesatpixel(pixelx, pixely,
withinBoundaries=True)</td>
<td>Returns a tuple (x, y) of the cell coordinates that the
pixel is in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>getcharatpixel(pixelx, pixely, withinBoundaries=True)</td>
<td>Returns the character in the cell that the pixel is in.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>NOTE:
The withinBounaries parameter, when set to True, will return (None,
None) or None if the parameters fall outside the window (that is, less
than 0 or greater than the width/height).</p>
<p>ANOTHER NOTE: Instead
of passing two separate values for the cellx &amp; celly (or pixelx
&amp; pixely) parameters, you can just pass a two-integer tuple for
the
cellx/pixelx parameter, and the method will understand that the
coordinates are both in that parameter.</p>
<p>There are also read-only attributes for getting the cell
coordinates of the various edges and midpoints, just like there are for
pygame.Rect objects:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 757px; height: 284px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">PygcurseWindow
Attribute</td>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>left, top</td>
<td>Always set to 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>right, bottom</td>
<td>Always set to width - 1 and height - 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>centerx, centery</td>
<td>The center row/column</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>center</td>
<td>Tuple of two integers: (centerx, centery)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright</td>
<td>Tuple of two integers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>midleft, midright</td>
<td>Tuple of two integers: (left, centery) and (right,
centery)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>midtop, midbottom</td>
<td>Tuple of two integers: (centerx, top) and (centerx,
bottom)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rect</td>
<td>A pygame.Rect object set to the cell coordinates of the
entire window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pixelrect</td>
<td>A pygame.Rect object set to the pixel coordinates of
the entire window.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So
if you want to display a string of text in the center row of the
window, you can use this code: win.pygprint('Hello world!',
y=win.centery)</p>
<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>
<p>Pygcurse
doesn't have any code that deals with the mouse. You simply check for
MOUSEMOTION events from pygame.event.get() as you would in any normal
Pygame program. The&nbsp;getcoordinatesatpixel() PygcurseWindow
method
will be helpful for converting from the mouse event's pixel coordinates
to the PygcurseWindow object's cell coordinates. This program displays
a red "@" character where the mouse is:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse, pygame, sys<br>from pygame.locals import *<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.colors = ('red', 'gray')<br>cellx = 0<br>celly = 0<br>while True:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win.setscreencolors(None, 'gray', clear=True)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for event in pygame.event.get():<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if event.type == QUIT or (event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_ESCAPE):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pygame.quit()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.exit()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if event.type == MOUSEMOTION:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cellx, celly = win.getcoordinatesatpixel(event.pos)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win.putchar('@', x=cellx, y=celly)<br></pre>

<pre><img style="width: 276px; height: 168px;" alt="" src="pygtut_mouse.png"></pre>
<h2>Controlling Flicker and autoupdate</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the mouse program flickers
considerable. This is caused because by default PygcurseWindow objects
try to handle updating the screen automatically whenever you call a
method that changes the screen. However, you may want to update the
screen several times, and then have the PygcurseWindow update itself on
the screen. In the previous mouse program, the setscreencolors() method
call grays out the entire screen (erasing any previous drawn @
character). Then the putchar() method call draws the @ character.
Because the entire window is constantly being grayed out, it looks like
the @ character is flickering.</p>
<p>We can fix this by disabling the autoupdate attribute of the
PygcurseWindow object (which is set to True by default.) Of course,
this means that we will have to call the PygcurseWindow.update() method
ourselves when our code is ready to draw the Pygcurse window to the
screen. Here's a non-flicker version of the mouse program (with two new
lines):</p>
<pre>import pygcurse, pygame, sys<br>from pygame.locals import *<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.colors = ('red', 'gray')<br>cellx = 0<br>celly = 0<br>win.autoupdate = False # THIS DISABLES THE AUTOUPDATE FEATURE<br>while True:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win.setscreencolors(None, 'gray', clear=True)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for event in pygame.event.get():<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if event.type == QUIT or (event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_ESCAPE):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pygame.quit()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.exit()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if event.type == MOUSEMOTION:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cellx, celly = win.getcoordinatesatpixel(event.pos)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win.putchar('@', x=cellx, y=celly)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win.update() # THIS IS THE NEW CALL TO THE UPDATE() METHOD</pre>
<p>Having the autoupdate feature enabled can be handy because
otherwise you'd have to call the update() method each time you called a
pygprint() or putchars() or fill() method (or any other method that
changes the content of the window). But if your program is constantly
redrawing the entire window like our mouse program, then it makes sense
to disable autoupdate.</p>
<h2>Copying PygcurseWindow Regions with the paste() Method</h2>
<p>Pygcurse lets you copy the characters, foreground color,
background color, and tint properties of a rectangular region of cells
and then paste it to other parts of the PygcurseWindow. The copy()
method returns a new PygcurseSurface object (which is the parent class
of PygcurseWindow and has almost all of the same methods) which can
then be pasted to another part of the PygcurseWindow. Note that any of
the properties can be copied (and the others will be left as None.) For
example, look at the code below:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br><br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(40, 25)<br>for k in pygcurse.colornames:<br> win.write('This is the color %s\n' % (k), fgcolor=k)<br>win.tint(100, 0, 0, region=(0, 0, 3, 3))<br>win.tint(0, 100, 0, region=(3, 0, 3, 3))<br>win.tint(0, 0, 100, region=(6, 0, 3, 3))<br><br>win.paste((0, 0, 9, 3), win, (5, 20, None, None))<br>win.paste((0, 0, 9, 3), win, (35, 15, None, None))<br>win.paste((0, 0, 9, 3), win, (33, -1, None, None))<br>win.pastechars((0, 0, 9, 3), win, (20, 8, None, None))<br>win.pastetint((0, 0, 9, 3), win, (-2, 7, None, None))<br>win.pastecolor((0, 0, 9, 3), win, (0, 13, None, None))<br><br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br></pre>
<p><img style="width: 536px; height: 363px;" alt="" src="pygtut_copypaste.png"></p>
<p>This program adds a red, green, and blue tint to some of the
areas in the upper left corner of the window, and then copies that
area. It then pastes it around to other XY coordinates on the window.
Notice that the pastechars() method call only pastes the characters,
and the foreground/background/tint color is the same as it was in the
cells before it was pasted. The same goes for the pastetint() method
call: only the tint was pasted, but not the text, foreground color, or
background color.</p>
<p>Here's a list of the various copy and paste methods for
copying the various properties of a rectangular region of cells. Note
that the first five parameters of the copy methods are the XYWHR
parameters, and have been omitted for brevity.</p>

<h2>Converting stdio Programs into Pygcurse Programs</h2>
It is easy to turn any normal Python program (called stdio or "standard
i/o" programs) that uses Python's print()
and input() functions into one that uses the Pygcurse library. The
benefit of doing this is that you can put the text in color, and also
add graphics by using Pygame's drawing functions on the PygcurseWindow
surface. (See the section about this below.)
<p>To convert a stdio Python program into a Pygcurse program,
just add the following lines to the beginning. Note that this only
works for Python 3.</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(40, 25, 'Your window caption here.')<br>print = win.pygprint<br>input = win.input<br>win.setscreencolors('lime', 'blue', clear=True)<br></pre>
<p>It is important that you specify clear=True for the
setscreencolors() call, otherwise you might get weird trails of text
when the screen scrolls. You can see an example of this with the
demo_tictactoe.py and
demo_reversi.py programs that come with Pygcurse.</p>
<blockquote>For Python 2, the situation is a bit different since
print is
not a function and the name of input() is raw_input(). In that case,
just use these six lines:<br>
<pre>import sys<br>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(40, 25, 'Your window caption here.')<br>sys.stdout = win<br>raw_input = win.raw_input<br>win.setscreencolors('lime', 'blue', clear=True)</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Drawing Functions</h2>
<p>Pygcurse
comes with some limited drawing functions. Currently there are only
functions for drawing "lines" of text characters. They are both methods
of PygcurseWindows</p>
<p>drawline(self, start_pos, end_pos, char=' ',
fgcolor=None, bgcolor=None) - Where start_pos and end_pos are
two-integer tuples that give XY cell coordinates.</p>
<p>drawlines(self,
pointlist, closed=False, char=' ', fgcolor=None, bgcolor=None) - Where
pointlist is a list/tuple of two-integer tuples that give XY cell
coordinates. If closed is True, then there will be a line drawn from
the last point to the first point.</p>
<p>fill(self, char=' ',
fgcolor=None, bgcolor=None, region=None) - Not so much a drawing
function, but if you need to draw a filled in rectangular space, then
the fill() method can do this.</p>
<p>Currently there is no circle or polygon functions, or
anti-aliased versions of these functions.</p>
<h2>Reversing and Inverting the Foreground or Background Colors</h2>
<p>"Reversing" the foreground and background color means setting
the
foreground color to be the background color and the background color to
be the foreground color. "Inverting" a color means to set the color to
it's inverse color (the color red has RGB values 255, 0, 0 while it's
inverse has RGB values of 0, 255, 255, which is aqua). These can be
done with the following PygcurseWindow methods:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">Inverse/Reverse Method</td>
<td style="font-weight: bold;">Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>invertcolors(self, region=None)</td>
<td>Invert the foreground and background colors of the
specified cells.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>invertfgcolor(self, region=None)</td>
<td>Invert only the foreground color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>invertbgcolor(self, region=None)</td>
<td>Invert only the background color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reversecolors(self, region=None)</td>
<td>Reverse the foreground and background colors.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note
that these functions do not change the PygcurseWindow's set foreground
or background color. They only modify the foreground and/or background
color of the cells specified in the region parameter. Here is a short
example program that demonstrates reversion and inversion (comment the
reversecolors() call and uncomment the invertcolors() call to see the
effects of inversion):</p>
<pre>import pygcurse<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.colors = ('red', 'green')<br>win.write('The Ojibway aboriginal people in North America used cowry shells which they called sacred Miigis Shells.')<br><br>while True:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win.reversecolors()<br> #win.invertcolors()</pre>
<h2>The PygcurseTextbox Class</h2>
<p>If you need to display text in a rectangular area, the
PygcurseTextbox class can help you easily manage this. It has options
for setting up a border, doing word-wrapping, and it handles displaying
the textbox even if it is partially off the screen. Here is the
constructor function (note that most of the parameters have default
values and are optional, only&nbsp;the pygsurf parameter is
required):</p>
PygcurseTextbox(pygsurf,
region=None, fgcolor=None, bgcolor=None, text='', wrap=True,
border='basic', caption='', margin=None, marginleft=0, marginright=0,
margintop=0, marginbottom=0, shadow=None, shadowamount=51)
<p>Here's an explanation of each of these parameters:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>PygcurseTextbox Constructor Parameter</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pygsurf</td>
<td>Required.
This is the PygcurseWindow or PygcurseSurface object that this textbox
will appear on. This can be changed later by assigning a new one to the
pygsurf attribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>region</td>
<td>The total size and position of the textbox, including
the border and margins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fgcolor, bgcolor</td>
<td>The
foreground and background colors of the textbox. The foreground color
is also used for the border characters (if there is one). Currently
PygcurseTextbox doesn't support multiple foreground/background colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>text</td>
<td>The text you want to appear in the textbox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wrap</td>
<td>If True, then word wrapping is enabled. Otherwise the
words will be broken across new lines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>border</td>
<td>Can be set to None, 'basic', 'rounded', or a
single-character string. None disables the border. The 'basic' style
uses - and | characters for the sides and + for the corners. The
'rounded' style uses / and \ characters for the corners. The
single-character string style will use that character for the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>caption</td>
<td>The
caption is a bit of text that will appear on the top row of the text
box. If the textbox has a border, then the caption will appear embedded
inside the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>margin, marginleft, marginright, margintop, marginbottom</td>
<td>The
margin parameter is an integer that sets how much space should be
between the border and the text in the textbox. The marginleft,
marginright, margintop, and marginbottomcan optionally be specified to
override the margin parameter. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>shadow, shadowamount</td>
<td>The
shadow parameter (if not set to None) makes a shadow displayed for the
textbox. The shadow parameter is set to one of Pygcurse's directional
constants (i.e. pygcurse.NORTHWEST, pygcurse.EAST, or
pygcurse.SOUTHEAST, etc.). The shadowamount is how dark you want the
shadow to be. 255 is maximum blackness, while -255 is maximum whiteness.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The
textbox is drawn to its associated PygcurseWindow object by calling its
update() method. The parameter names are also used for attribute names,
which can be set to change the PygcurseTextbox object after it has been
created. See the demo_textboxtest.py program for example code:</p>
<p><img style="width: 536px; height: 363px;" alt="" src="pygtut_textbox.png"></p>
<h2>Drawing on the Pygcurse Window with Pygame Drawing Functions</h2>
<p>Because Pygcurse is built on top of Pygame, you can use all of
Pygame's drawing functions on the PygcurseWindow object. This means
that your programs are not limited to only ascii characters.</p>
<h2>Resizing the Windows</h2>
At
this time resizing the PygcurseWindow and PygcurseSurface objects isn't
completely tested, but it is still possible. The resize() method allows
you to specify a new width and height. If you are increasing the size
of the Pygcurse surface, then you can also specify an fgcolor and
bgcolor parameter to set the new cells to these colors. (Otherwise the
current fgcolor and bgcolor will be used.) Calling resize() will reset
the cursor to 0, 0. If None is passed for the width or height, then the
width or height will not be changed, respectively. The exact parameters
are as follows:
<pre>resize(self, newwidth=None, newheight=None, fgcolor=None, bgcolor=None)</pre>
<h2>Using Other Fonts</h2>
<p>A PygcurseWindow or PygcurseSurface object can only display
one font
and size at a time, but you can change the font and size by assigning a
new pygame.font.Font object to the font. The following program displays
the default system fontCont&nbsp; at various sizes:</p>
<pre>import pygcurse, pygame<br>win = pygcurse.PygcurseWindow(20, 10)<br>win.write('The Ojibway aboriginal people in North America used cowry shells which they called sacred Miigis Shells.')<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br>win.font = pygame.font.Font(None, 42)<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()<br>win.font = pygame.font.Font(None, 8)<br>pygcurse.waitforkeypress()</pre>
<h2>The Debug Methods</h2>
<p>Pygcurse has some functions for debugging. &nbsp;They each
have a
returnStr parameter which is False by default. If True, then the debug
method will return a multiline string with the debug info. If False,
then it will write it to sys.stdout. The debug messages just create
strings that mimic the current layout of the PygcurseWindow's various
properties. They are: _debugchars, _debugfg, _debugbg, _debugdirty.</p>
<h2>Misc Functions:
interpretkeyevent,&nbsp;splitintogroupsof,
getwithinrange,&nbsp;getpygamecolor, waitforkeypress</h2>
<p>TODO - Will be filled in later. These are just extra functions
that exist in the pygcurse module, not as PygcurseWindow methods.</p>
