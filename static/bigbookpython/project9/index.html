<p class="chapterintro">This is a simple and silly bluffing game for two human players. Each player has a box. One box has a carrot in it, and each player wants to have the carrot. The first player looks in their box and then tells the second player they either do or don’t have the carrot. The second player gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.</p>
<p class="calibre18">The ASCII art in the code makes typing this program take a while (though copying and pasting the ASCII art can speed up the task), but this project is good for beginners because it is straightforward, with minimal looping and no defined functions.</p>

<p class="bodyfirst">When you run <em class="calibre9">carrotinabox.py</em>, the output will look like this:</p>
<pre class="calibre24"><code class="calibre22">Carrot in a Box, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
<var class="calibre27">--snip--</var>
Human player 1, enter your name: <b class="calibre6">Alice</b>
Human player 2, enter your name: <b class="calibre6">Bob</b>
HERE ARE TWO BOXES:
  __________     __________
 /         /|   /         /|
+---------+ |  +---------+ |
|   RED   | |  |   GOLD  | |
|   BOX   | /  |   BOX   | /
+---------+/   +---------+/
   Alice           Bob

Alice, you have a RED box in front of you.
Bob, you have a GOLD box in front of you.
Press Enter to continue...
<var class="calibre27">--snip--</var>
When Bob has closed their eyes, press Enter...
Alice here is the inside of your box:

   ___VV____
  |   VV    |
  |   VV    |
  |___||____|    __________
 /    ||   /|   /         /|

|   RED   | |  |   GOLD  | |
|   BOX   | /  |   BOX   | /
+---------+/   +---------+/
 (carrot!)
   Alice           Bob
Press Enter to continue...
<var class="calibre27">--snip--</var></code></pre>
<h2 id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre5">How It Works</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">This program relies on the second player closing their eyes so they don’t see the contents of the first player’s box. In order to keep the second player from seeing the box contents after this step, we need to find a way to clear the screen. Line 83 does this with <code class="calibre22">print('\n' * 100)</code>. This prints 100 newline characters, causing the previously printed content to scroll up and out of view. This keeps the second player from accidentally seeing what was only intended for the first player. While the second player could always scroll up to see this text, it’d be obvious to the first player, who’s sitting right next to them, that they had done so.</p>
<p class="calibre19">On lines 114, 130, and 142, the spacing of the vertical lines may look incorrect, but the program replaces the curly braces with the string <code class="calibre22">'RED '</code> <span type="pagebreak" title="43" id="calibre_link-411" class="calibre20"></span>(with a space at the end) or <code class="calibre22">'GOLD'</code>. The four characters in these strings will cause the rest of the box’s vertical lines to line up with the rest of the ASCII-art image.</p>
