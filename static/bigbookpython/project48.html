<p class="chapterintro">The Monty Hall Problem illustrates a surprising fact of probability. The problem is loosely based on the old game show <em class="calibre9">Let’s Make a Deal</em> and its host, Monty Hall. In the Monty Hall Problem, you can pick one of three doors. Behind one door is a prize: a new car. Each of the other two doors opens onto a worthless goat. Say you pick Door #1. Before the door you choose is opened, the host opens another door (either #2 or #3), which leads to a goat. You can choose to either open the door you originally picked or switch to the other unopened door.</p>
<p class="calibre18">It may seem like it doesn’t matter if you switch or not, but your odds do improve if you switch doors! This program demonstrates the Monty Hall problem by letting you do repeated experiments.</p>
<p class="calibre19">To understand why your odds improve, consider a version of the Monty Hall Problem with one thousand doors instead of three. You pick one door, and then the host opens 998 doors, which all reveal goats. The only two <span type="pagebreak" title="239" id="calibre_link-607" class="calibre20"></span>doors that are unopened are the one you selected and one other door. If you correctly picked the car door to begin with (a 1 in a 1,000 chance), then the host left a random goat door closed. If you picked a goat door (a 999 in a 1,000 chance), the host specifically chose the car door to leave closed. The choice of which doors to open isn’t random; the host knows to leave the car door closed. It’s almost certain that you didn’t pick the car door to begin with, so you should switch to the other door.</p>
<p class="calibre19">Another way to think of it is that you have 1,000 boxes and one box contains a prize. You guess which box the prize is in and the host puts it in your hands. Do you think the prize is in your box or one of the 999 other boxes? You don’t need the host to open 998 of the 999 boxes that don’t contain a prize; the amount of choice is the same as with the 1,000 doors. The odds that you guessed correctly in the beginning are 1 in 1,000, while the odds that you did not (and that the prize is in one of the other boxes) is a near certain 999 in 1,000.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre5">How It Works</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">The multiline strings for the ASCII-art doors are stored in several constant variables, such as <code class="calibre22">ALL_CLOSED</code>, <code class="calibre22">FIRST_GOAT</code>, and <code class="calibre22">FIRST_CAR_OTHERS_GOAT</code>. The code that uses these constants, like <code class="calibre22">print(FIRST_GOAT)</code> on line 125, stays the same even if we update the graphics. By placing the multiline strings together toward the top of the source code file, we’ll have an easier time comparing them to make sure the graphics are consistent.</p>
