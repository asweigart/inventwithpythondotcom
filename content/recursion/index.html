<p>Ace the Coding Interview with Python and Javascript</p>

<p>Recursion, and recursive algorithms, have a reputation for being intimidating. They're seen as an advanced computer science topic often brought up in coding interviews. Moreover, coders often perceive the use of a recursive algorithm as a sophisticated solution that only true programmers can produce. But there's nothing magical about recursion. Its fearsome reputation is more a product of poor teaching than of the complexity of recursion itself.</p>

<p>This book teaches the basics of recursion, exposes the ways it's often poorly taught, and clarifies the fundamental principles behind all recursive algorithms. It is project-based, containing complete, runnable programs in both Python and JavaScript, and covers several common recursive algorithms for tasks like calculating factorials, producing numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, tree traversal, maze solving, binary search, quicksort and merge sort, Karatsuba multiplication, permutations and combinations, and solving the eight queens problem. </p>

<p>The book also explains tail call optimization and memoization, concepts often employed to produce effective recursive algorithms, and the call stack, which is a critical part of how recursive functions work but is almost never explicitly pointed out in lessons on recursion. The last chapter, on fractals, culminates with examples of the beautiful fractal shapes recursion can produce.</p>

      <h2>Receive a Free Review Copy</h2>

      <p>If you'd like to receive a free print copy of <em>Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition</em>, please fill out the form at <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/u1PoLWLRl6fZ7nQX2">https://goo.gl/forms/u1PoLWLRl6fZ7nQX2</a>. Please specify you want "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python". You'll receive a free ebook to read, and upon posting a review to Amazon, you will receive a complementary print review copy of the book. (UPDATE: There's been a large amount of interest, and I can't guarantee you'll get a print book. However, I can definitely send you an ebook to review.)</p>

      <p><strong>To demonstrate that you will be able to write a review, please send me a link to an Amazon, Goodreads, or Powells review you have written before.</strong> If you haven't written an Amazon review before, please explicitly tell me in your email you have an Amazon account and can post reviews. <em>Also, please include the word "walrus" in the subject of your email so I know you read this.</em> I'm happy to send out books to reviewers, but I can only respond to serious inquiries from folks who have read these instructions.</p>

      <p>Please post an honest review. Posting a negative review will not impact whether or not you get a free print book. The only requirements are that the review be a minimum of 100 words, you must live within the United States (due to shipping costs), you must have purchased $50 off Amazon in the last year (Amazon has this requirement before you can write a review), and that you email me first before writing the review.</p>
