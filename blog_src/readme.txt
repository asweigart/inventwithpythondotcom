To generate the blog, run:

C:\github\inventwithpythondotcom\blog_src>pelican content

Note that these files get copied to C:\github\inventwithpythondotcom\static\blog, so I need to run my website generation script after that to put the changes in the `output` folder.

Note that the voidy-bootstrap files come from C:\Users\Al\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Lib\site-packages\pelican\themes\voidy-bootstrap, not from C:\github\inventwithpythondotcom\static\blog\theme
