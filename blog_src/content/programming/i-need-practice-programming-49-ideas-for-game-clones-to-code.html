    <body>
			<p>So you know a little bit about programming (perhaps you've read the free book, <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/">"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python"</a>, a free programming book for beginners whose author shamelessly plugs at every chance) but you want to get better at coding. You can't seem to find any open source projects that are at your level or easy for new people to contribute to. You've gone through a few of the practice problems at <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> but you want to create something more substantial, or at least a cool thing you can show your friends. (Not that finding the 31337th prime number isn't cool.)</p>
<p>Here's a list of game clone ideas for you to implement. Each has a short description of the game, links to videos of the game, and descriptions of what kind of algorithms you'll need to know in order to implement them. <strong>These games have been selected for their simplicity</strong>, so you don't have to spend several weeks designing art, levels, scripted dialogue, or complicated AI. These are clones designed to be doable in roughly a weekend. A Mario or Zelda clone would be complicated to put together, but a Tetris or Asteroids clone would be doable in a weekend.</p>
<h2 id="orisinal">Orisinal Games:</h2>
<p><a href="/blogstatic/orisinal_tea.jpg"><img src="/blogstatic/orisinal_tea.jpg" width="200" /></a></p>
<p>The Orisinal website has a great collection of Flash games with very simple mechanics that can be copied. <a href="http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/">http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/</a></p>
<p>I especially recommend <a href="http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm">Winter Bells</a>, <a href="http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/tea.htm">A Daily Cup of Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bugs.htm">Bugs</a>, and <a href="http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g2/rope.htm">Hold the Rope!</a></p>
<p>The Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_clone#Notable_cloned_games">video game clones</a> also lists some ideas.</p>
<p>UPDATE: If you'd like to make some more advanced games, I highly recommend you watch the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">Juice it or lose it - a talk by Martin Jonasson & Petri Purho</a> on some simple tweaks and tricks that turn a simple pong game into a really polished looking pong game.</p>
<h2>Games from "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" and "Making Games with Python & Pygame" books:</h2>
<p>These games are described in these free Python programming books and their source code is available. However, you can make your own variants.</p>
<h2 id="dodger">1. Dodger</h2>
<p><a href="/images/20-1.png"><img src="/images/20-1.png" width="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Several bad guys fall from the top of the screen, and the user must avoid them. The player can be controlled with the arrow keys or more directly with the mouse. The longer the player lasts without being hit, the higher the score.</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong> Have enemies fall at different rates and be different sizes. Have enemies fall from more than one side of the game. Have power up pickups that grant invulnerability for a while, slow down bad guys, give the player a temporary "reverse bad guys" power, etc.</p>
<p>This game is covered in <a href="/chapter20.html">Chapter 20 of "Invent with Python"</a></p>

<h2 id="memorypuzzle">2. Memory Puzzle</h2>
<p><a href="/images/memory_screenshot.png"><img src="/images/memory_screenshot.png" width="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A board full of overturned cards. There is a pair for each card. The player flips over two cards. If they match, then they stay overturned. Otherwise they flip back. The player needs to overturn all the cards in the fewest moves to win.</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong> Provide "hints" in the form of four possible matching cards after the player flips the first one. Or, quickly overturn groups of cards at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>This game is covered in <a href="/pygame/chapter1.html">Chapter 1 of "Making Games with Python & Pygame"</a></p>

<h2 id="slidingpuzzle">3. Sliding Puzzle</h2>
<p><a href="/images/slidepuzzle_screenshot.png"><img src="/images/slidepuzzle_screenshot.png" width="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A 4x4 board of numbered tiles has one missing space and is randomly set up. To win the game, the player must slide tiles over to put the tiles back in order.</p>
<p><strong>Variants:</strong> Instead of numbers, you can have a scrambled picture cut up into 4x4 tiles.</p>
<p>This game is covered in <a href="/pygame/chapter4.html">Chapter 4 of "Making Games with Python & Pygame"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="simon">4. Simon</h2>
<p><a href="/images/simulate_screenshot.png"><img src="/images/simulate_screenshot.png" width="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Four colored buttons light up in a specific pattern. After displaying the pattern, the player must repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in proper order. The pattern gets longer each time the player completes the pattern. If the player presses a wrong button, the game ends.</p>
<p>Variant: A nine-button version can add challenge to this game (but more than that would probably just be tedious.)</p>
<p>This game is covered in <a href="/pygame/chapter5.html">Chapter 5 of "Making Games with Python & Pygame"</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/simulate.py">Download Pyhton Source: simulate.py</a></p>
<h2 id="nibbles">5. Nibbles</h2>
<p><a href="/images/snakey_screenshot.png"><img src="/images/snakey_screenshot.png" width="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A worm or snake constantly moves around the board. The player controls the direction the "head" of the worm moves, and the worm must try to eat apples that randomly appear. Eating an apply causes the worm to grow in length. The game ends if the worm crashes into the edge of the board or into itself.</p>
<p><strong>Variants:</strong> Add walls to the level, instead of just a blank rectangle. Add power ups that the worm can pick up. Add bad guys that move around the board that the worm must avoid. Have two worms that the player must control simultaenously. Tron (see below) is a two-player variant of this game.</p>
<p>This game is covered in <a href="/pygame/chapter6.html">Chapter 6 of "Making Games with Python & Pygame"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="katamaridamacy">7. Katamari Damacy</h2>
<p><a href="/images/squirrel_screenshot.png"><img src="/images/squirrel_screenshot.png" width="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The original Katamari Damacy game was in a 3d world, but a 2d version is also easy to implement. The player controls a small object in a world of different-sized objects. Touching the smaller objects grows the player, touching the larger objects damages or shrinks the player. The player wins when they reach a certain size.</p>
<p><a href="http://dagobah.net/flash/katamari.swf">A flash version of 2D Katamari is available.</a></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The player is in a level with objects that need to be pushed over goals. The objects can only be pushed, they can't be pulled. This game does require some effort to design levels for, but Sokoban levels have been <a href="http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/">designed by others and published on the web</a>.</p>
<p>Variant: Add all sorts of level gimmicks: teleport tiles, conveyor belts, buttons that open doors/bridges, buttons that need an object left on them to keep a door open.</p>

<h2 id="othello">9. Othello</h2>
<p><a href="/images/flippy_screenshot.png"><img src="/images/flippy_screenshot.png" width="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> On a grid, a black and white player places tiles of their color on the board. The opponent's tiles between the newly placed tile and that player's existing tiles are flipped to become the color of the player's tiles. The game ends when the board fills up and the player with the most tiles of their color wins.</p>
<p>Variant: Three player Othello with three different colors. Non-square boards.</p>

<h2>Board Games:</h2>
<p>Board games are a good source for game clone ideas. A game like Monopoly has far too many rules to put together in a short time frame, but here's a list of board games that have simple mechanics. Chess, Go, and Stratego may be too complicated to create an AI opponent, but in that case you can just make it a two-player game. These games don't really have variants, </p>

After each round, the player can spend actions on finding new weapons, finding other survivors to help defend, or repairing the barricade.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> A puzzle game where the player must roll over a 2x1 brick to an exit point on the map. The brick cannot be moved off the edge of the board, and since it can only be flipped end over end and not slid around, the 2x1 nature restricts the types of moves it can make.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> A very original but obscure puzzle game on the NES. The player controls a wizard who can make and unmake ice cubes, which need to fall on all the fire in a level to clear it. The ice can also be used as platforms, and individual blocks of ice can be pushed around. (As a platformer, making a clone of this might be a bit more involved. But the concept is original enough where I think it'd be worth the effort.)</p>
