<p>TL;DR: Open two terminal windows and run <code>watch "git status"</code> in one and <code>watch "git log -oneline"</code> in the other so you can get live feedback as you enter Git commands.</p>

<p>Version control is a necessary skill for all software developers, and GUI tools for a version control system like Git make Git easy to use. But you'll often only have access to a command line, so it's still important to learn Git's command line commands. Here's two tricks (invent by a programmer!) you can do to make learning and using the Git command line easier.</p>

<p>The <code>git status</code> command shows which files are unmodified, modified, or untracked while the <code>git log --oneline</code> command shows the first line of every commit message. This is useful information to have, and you'll constantly run these commands as you use Git.</p>

<p>To make this easier, you can have the <code>watch</code> command run these automatically. The <code>watch</code> command repeatedly runs a command you give it, refreshing the screen with the command's output. Open a new terminal window, and run <code>watch "git status"</code> to have an automatically updated view of the Git repo's status. In another terminal window, run <code>watch "git log --oneline"</code> to see a log that is automatically updated every time you commit changes.</p>

<p>(These tricks aren't weird, but I wanted to follow the clickbait headline template in an attempt at humor that will surely date this article.)</p>

<p>The <code>watch</code> command comes standard with macOS and Linux. However, <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/watchpython">you'll have to download <code>watch.exe</code> separately on Windows</a> and place it in a folder in the system PATH. (If you don't know what that is, you can always place it in C:\Windows if you have an admin account.)</p>
