<p><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/pygcurse/">Pygcurse</a> (pronounced "pig curse") is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_%28programming_library%29">curses library</a> emulator that runs on top of the <a href="http://pygame.org/">Pygame framework</a>. It provides an easy way to create text adventures, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a>, and console-style applications. The mascot of Pygcurse is a blue pig with a skull tattoo on its butt.</p>

<p>Pygcurse provides several benefits over normal text-based stdio programs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Color text and background.</li>
<li>The ability to move the cursor and print text anywhere in the console window.</li>
<li>The ability to make console apps that make use of the mouse.</li>
<li>The ability to have programs respond to individual key presses, instead of waiting for the user to type an entire string and press enter (as is the case with input()/raw_input()).</li>
<li>The ability to use any font and any character in those fonts.</li>
<li>Since the console window that Pygcurse uses is just a Pygame surface object, additional drawing and transformations can be applied to it. Multiple surfaces can also be used in the same program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pygcurse also provides some additional features that curses normally doesn't, such as tinting, shadows, textboxes, and line drawing functions.</p>
<p>Pygcurse requires Pygame to be installed. Pygame can be downloaded from <a href="http://pygame.org/">http://pygame.org</a>. Pygcurse can be used with either Python 2 or Python 3.</p>
