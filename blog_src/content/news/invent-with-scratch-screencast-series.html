			<p>I've created a series of video screencast tutorials for Scratch. Scratch is a block-based programming environment from MIT. It is a programming education toy that is made for kids between the ages of 8 and 16. The screencasts can be found at:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://inventwithscratch.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://inventwithscratch.com', '&quot;Invent with Scratch&quot; Screencast at http://inventwithscratch.com']);" >"Invent with Scratch" Screencast at http://inventwithscratch.com</a></strong></p>
<p>Scratch itself is hosted at <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://scratch.mit.edu', 'http://scratch.mit.edu']);" >http://scratch.mit.edu</a></p>
<p>I highly recommend Scratch as a teaching tool for younger kids who may not be ready for Python programming or are frustrated by their slow typing. Scratch is a drag-and-drop environment with code "blocks" that snap together.</p>
