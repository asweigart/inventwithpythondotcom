<p>The 3rd edition of "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" is now available. The 3rd edition has been streamlined to provide the same content but in 50 fewer pages, making it an easier read. If you've already read the 2nd edition, there's no need to read the 3rd (unless you want to sharpen your Python skills). But for new readers, Invent with Python should be even easier to pick up.</p>
