        <p>I've written an article for <a href="https://opensource.com/">OpenSource.com</a> called <a href="https://opensource.com/education/15/9/apis-not-apps">APIs, not apps: What the future will be like when everyone can code</a>, where I write about a coming future where programming ability is in the hands of everyone.</p>

        <p>Excerpt:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Despite this hype, I do think that coding will become a more widespread and routine skill in the years to come. Programmable technology will continue to pervade more parts of our life, computers will continue to become more accessible to a wider population, and the world will continue to become more complex. Understanding coding (and debugging) will naturally go with it.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>These are areas where non-programmers can significantly boost their productivity by learning to code. This is different from everyone becoming a software engineer. When I say learn to code, I don't mean develop software professionally. Almost every adult has a driver's license, but only a minority are cab drivers or NASCAR racers.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Universal coding literacy doesn't increase the supply of web services so much as increase the sophistication in how web services are used. Programming—by which I mean being able to direct a computer to access data, organize it, and then make decisions based on it— will open up not only a popular ability to make more of online services, but also to demand more.</p>
