<p>My new programming book, the Recursive Book of Recursion, is released in August 2022. The book covers several classic recursive algorithms and breaks down recursion's fearsome reputation as a programming technique. The book has the code for its numerous programs in both Python and JavaScript. When you <a href="https://nostarch.com/recursive-book-recursion">buy it direct from the publisher, No Starch Press</a>, you'll receive a DRM-free ebook copy with your print book order.

<!--The downloadable resources contains all of the programs in the book.-->

<p>Here's the contents of the book:</p>

<p><b>Part 1: Understanding Recursion</b></p>

<b>Chapter 1: What Is Recursion?</b> - Explains recursion and how it is the natural result of the way programming languages implement functions and function <p>calls. This chapter also argues that recursion isn’t nearly the elegant, mystical concept many claim it is.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: Recursion vs. Iteration</b> - Dives into the differences (and many similarities) between recursive and iterative techniques.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Classic Recursion Algorithms</b> - Covers famous recursive programs such as the Tower of Hanoi, the flood fill algorithm, and others.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 4: Backtracking and Tree Traversal Algorithms</b> - Discusses a problem for which recursion is particularly suited: traversing tree data structures, such as when solving mazes and navigating a directory.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/tree-and-not-tree-fig-4-1.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 5: Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms</b> - Discusses how recursion is useful for splitting large problems into smaller subproblems and covers </p>several common divide-and-conquer algorithms.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/sort-books-fig-5-2.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 6: Permutations and Combinations</b> - Covers recursive algorithms involving ordering and matching, as well as the common programming problems to which these techniques are applied.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/wedding-guest-permutation-fig-6-2.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 7: Memoization and Dynamic Programming</b> - Explains some simple tricks to improve code efficiency when applying recursion in the real world.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/fib-fig-7-1.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 8: Tail Call Optimization</b> - Covers tail call optimization, a common technique used to improve the performance of recursive algorithms, and how it works.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/tco-factorial-fig-8-1.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 9: Drawing Fractals</b> - Tours the intriguing art that can be programmatically produced by recursive algorithms. This chapter makes use of turtle graphics for generating its images.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/sierpinsky-fig-9-3.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Part 2: Projects</b></p>

<p><b>Chapter 10: File Finder</b> - Covers a project that searches through the files on your computer according to custom search parameters you provide.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/file-finder-fig-10-1.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 11: Maze Generator</b> - Covers a project that automatically generates mazes of any size using the recursive backtracker algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/maze-gen-fig-11-1.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 12: Sliding-Tile Solver</b> - Covers a project that solves sliding-tile puzzles, also called 15-puzzles.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/sliding-tile-solver-fig-12-2.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 13: Fractal Art Maker</b> - Explores a project that can produce custom fractal art of your own design.</p>

<p><img src="/blogstatic/recursion/three-corners-fig-13-9.webp" /></p>

<p><b>Chapter 14: Droste Maker</b> - Explores a project that produces recursive, picture-in-picture images using the Pillow image-manipulation module.</p>
