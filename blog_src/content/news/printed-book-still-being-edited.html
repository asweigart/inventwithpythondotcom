			<p>I'm currently doing a very slow and thorough read through of the book to weed out the last of the typos, errors, and ambiguous statements in the book. Currently I'm about 2/3 of the way through the book, so it may be another couple of weeks from now that the book will be available for sale in print.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I plan on adding more videos and online traces to the website. A forum is also in the works, as soon asÂ  potential spam issues are worked out.</p>
<p>Of course, the book will remain free online now and after the book goes for sale.</p>
