<p>I've completed my next book, which focuses on the Pygame library and making graphical games in Python. It assumes you have a little bit of Python programming knowledge. The book is free to read online from <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/pygame">http://inventwithpython.com/pygame</a> and can also be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=playwithpyth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0982106017', 'bought on Amazon.com for $25']);" >bought on Amazon.com for $25</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who helped me out with this book over the last year and a half.</p>
