<p>Hello, I'm Al Sweigart. I'm the author of <a href="https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>, and I'll be doing a live online Python class for beginner- and intermediate-level programmers on Twitch on Monday evening, October 21, 2019. The URL is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/alsweigart/">https://www.twitch.tv/alsweigart/</a> and the stream will begin at <strong>6pm Pacific</strong>. If you want to join in the chat, you'll need to sign up for a (free) account on Twitch. However, you'll be able to watch the stream without an account. I'll post a link to the video if you're reading this after the stream.</p>

<p>I'll also be releasing a free code for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/automate/">my online course that follows the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"</a> on the stream (and on this page after the stream). Unfortunately, due to changes in Udemy's policies, this code will only work for three days and will stop working after Wednesday, October 23. Udemy has limited how often I can make free codes, so I won't be able to create new ones for those who miss this one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW">You'll be still be able to watch the first 15 videos of the 50-video course at anytime on YouTube.</a></p>

<p>EDIT: The coupon code is OCT2019FREE, but is only valid until Wednesday, October 23, 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Class Format:</strong> The format for the class is that I'll be working through several beginner level coding projects. I'll take a look at these programs, and show you how I write them step by step. You can follow along, or simply re-type the source code yourself and try running the programs. The programs are from <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogames">a repo of small, simple Python games I've been developing</a>.</p>

<p>The programs we'll be covering, in order starting at 6pm, are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/zigzag.py">Zig Zag animation</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/rockpaperscissors.py">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/rockpaperscissorsalwayswin.py">Rock, Paper, Scissors but the Player Always Wins</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/game2048.py">2048</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/mancala.py">Mancala</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can read through the code to familiarize yourself with them beforehand, but it isn't required. I expect the process for each of these programs will be:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Explaining what the game is or what the program does.</li>
    <li>A demonstration of running the completed program.</li>
    <li>Starting with a blank file, and stubbing out the general parts of the program with comments.</li>
    <li>Filling in the code while describing the data structures/algorithms used.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll be copying the code from GitHub exactly, which is a bit artificial in the way that I normally write code, but I'm doing it this way so that the audience doesn't have to follow exactly along with code as I type. Instead, you can move slower or faster by copying the code from the repo. I recommend having a browser window open with the code and copying it by typing it yourself (as opposed to copy/pasting it).</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You'll be expected to have Python 3 installed on your computer along with an IDE or text editor for writing Python programs, such as IDLE or PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. This class is for beginners, but not complete beginners: I'll expect that you've written a "Hello world" program and gotten it to run on your computer. However, even if you're a complete beginner, feel free to watch along to get an idea for how programs are written by programmers.</p>

<p>I offer a blog post I wrote, <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2018/02/02/how-to-ask-for-programming-help/">"How to Ask for Programming Help"</a> to read before the live stream. There are several techniques that make it much easier for folks to answer your questions (copy/pasting your code to a pastebin, stating the exact error message, describing what you've already tried, describing your OS and Python versions, etc.) that can make it much easier to answer your questions.</p>

<p>Questions are welcome, but unfortunately <em>I cannot help you with environment setup on your computer</em>. This tends to hold up the class for hours, and it'd mean I couldn't progress with the class. Please make sure you are able to run a <code>print('Hello, world!')</code> program on your computer. The projects are designed to not require any third-party modules or additional libraries that need to be installed.</p>

<p><strong>Streaming Schedule:</strong> I hope to make this a regular occurring stream, and I'll be taking notes on the format and what works and what doesn't. I hope to make this a weekly or twice-weekly event. This is a casual streaming event on the internet, but you should treat it as a professional event with mixed company. The general rules for chat are stated as, "No harassment, offensive/edgy/"ironic" jokes, or complaining about moderators. Keep it classy and on topic. Young adults should be able to watch and participate without their parents cringing."</p>
