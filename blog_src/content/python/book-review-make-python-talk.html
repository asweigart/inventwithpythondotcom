<p>Mark H. Liu’s “Make Python Talk” is a solid book for anyone who wants to leverage the power of the Python programming language to add speech capabilities to their programs. The chapters cover third-party libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech in an engaging way. This book is more than a dry reference for these libraries, but also contains several example projects demonstrating how you can use these speech features in a variety of contexts. You don’t have to have computer science expertise to add these advanced features to your own projects; Liu’s book presents these speech software libraries with clarity and ease.</p>

<p>If you’ve stumbled through the documentation for Python’s speech libraries but are still unsure of how to actually make effective use of them, I recommend you give Make Python Talk a look.</p>
