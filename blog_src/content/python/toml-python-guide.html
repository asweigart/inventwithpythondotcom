<h2>TOML Parser To Be Included In Python 3.11</h2>

<p>The Python language steering council has accepted PEP 680, which adds a TOML parser to the Python standard library. This means in Python 3.11, you'll be able to <code>import tomllib</code> and have a module that can parse TOML files.</p>

<p>But what are TOML files and why is a TOML parser being added to Python? This blog explains what TOML files look like, how they're used, and the Python code that lets you parse them.</p>

<p>TOML stands for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language. It is a way to structure data in a text file, much like what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> files do. The TOML standard is set up so that it's easy for humans to write TOML files in a text editor for use as configuration files. Here's an example TOML file:</p>

<pre># My Dungeons & Dragons character.
name = "Mordnilap"
class = "Magic user"
maxHP = 14
currentHP = 2

inventory = ["apple", "enchanted staff", "healing potion"]

cursed = false

[spells]
# The integers represent how many times a day they can be cast.
fireball = 3
featherFall = 2
</pre>

<p>With the TOML parser that will be in Python 3.11, you'll be able to parse this text and turn into the following Python dictionary:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'class'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Magic user'</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'currentHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'cursed'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">False</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'inventory'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'apple'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'enchanted staff'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'healing potion'</span><span class="p">],</span>
 <span class="s1">'maxHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Mordnilap'</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'spells'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'featherFall'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'fireball'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">}}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Python already has standard library modules for parsing XML and JSON text (with the <code>xml</code> and <code>json</code> modules, respectively.) There are third-party modules for parsing TOML files, but Python 3.11 will include one in the standard library so that all Python programs can access it without the additional step of installing a third-party TOML parsing module.</p>

<p>TOML files aren't specific to Python. TOML is just a format for text files, and programs written in any programming language can read them. But many tools in the Python ecosystem use the TOML format, so it's not a big surprise that a TOML parser is being added to the Python standard library.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example TOML file above, TOML is a great format for structuring data for configuration files. It doesn't have same column-and-row format that an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file would use though.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example TOML file above, TOML is a great format for structuring data for configuration files. It doesn't have same column-and-row format that an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file would use though.</p>

<p>In Python 3.11, the TOML module will be named <code>tomllib</code>, since a third-party module named <code>toml</code> already exists. The TOML module in 3.11 will be based on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tomli/">the existing <code>tomli</code> third-party module</a>.</p>

<h2>Writing Python Code with tomli</h2>

<p>You don't have to wait for Python 3.11 to be released to use it today. You can install <code>tomli</code> with the pip tool by running <code>pip3 install --user tomli</code> in a Terminal window on macOS and Linux, or by running <code>pip install --user tomli</code> in a Command Prompt window on Windows. (Don't run this from the Python interactive shell; that doesn't work.)</p>

<p>Much like how the <code>json</code> module has functions named <code>load()</code> and <code>loads()</code> (which is pronounced "load s" or "load string", not "loads"), the <code>tomli</code> third-party library (and future <code>tomllib</code> module in Python 3.11) has <code>load()</code> and <code>loads()</code> functions.</p>

<p>For example, say we had the Dungeons & Dragons text above in a TOML file named <em>dnd_character.toml</em>. We could read into our Python program with the following code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tomli</span>  <span class="c1"># import tomllib in Python 3.11</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pprint</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'dnd_character.toml'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">fileObj</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fileObj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="n">dnd_char</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tomli</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">loads</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">pprint</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pprint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dnd_char</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The output of this program from the <code>pprint</code> "pretty print" module is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'class'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Magic user'</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'currentHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'cursed'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">False</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'inventory'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'apple'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'enchanted staff'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'healing potion'</span><span class="p">],</span>
 <span class="s1">'maxHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Mordnilap'</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s1">'spells'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'featherFall'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'fireball'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">}}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>toml.loads()</code> function takes a string that we pulled out of a text file named <em>dnd_character.toml</em>. This string could have come from anywhere (say, downloading it off the web with the <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a> module). But since reading it from a <em>.toml</em> file is so common, the <code>tomli.load()</code> function can accept the file object directly:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tomli</span>  <span class="c1"># import tomllib in Python 3.11</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pprint</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'dnd_character.toml'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'rb'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">fileObj</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">dnd_char</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tomli</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fileObj</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">pprint</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pprint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dnd_char</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the file object you pass to <code>tomli.load()</code> has to be open in "read binary" mode, and not just the default "read text" mode, so you need to pass <code>'rb'</code> as the second argument to the <code>open()</code> function.</p>

<p>Unlike the <code>json</code> module's <code>dumps()</code> function, there is no <code>tomli.dumps()</code> function that can <em>create</em> text for TOML files. This is because while JSON is meant to be human-readable and read and written by programs, TOML files are meant to be used for configuration files. These files are often read and written by humans, but only read by software. There is a third-party module called <code>toml-w</code> that has a <code>tomli-w.dumps()</code> function for writing TOML-structured text. The <code>dumps()</code> function won't be a part of the <code>tomllib</code> module in the Python 3.11 standard library though.</p>

<h2>Writing TOML Files in a Text Editor</h2>

<p>We've covered how your Python programs can read in TOML files. But when you write TOML by hand, you'll need to know the syntax of the TOML format. Fortunately, Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language has an obvious, minimal format that's easy to remember. (For full details, you can read the <a href="https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0">documentation on the TOML website</a>.)</p>

<p>TOML files can have <strong>comments</strong> which are ignored by parsers. They look like Python comments: beginning with a <code>#</code> and extending to the end of the line. Blank lines are also allowed and ignored in TOML files.</p>

<p>The basic <strong>key-value pairs</strong> are written like Python assignment statements, with the key and value separated by an equal sign:</p>

<pre>name = "Mordnilap"
class = "Magic user"
maxHP = 14
currentHP = 2</pre>

<p>The <code>tomli.loads()</code> function takes the above TOML and returns the following Python dictionary:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Mordnilap'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'class'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Magic user'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'maxHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'currentHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>TOML has a few standard <strong>data types</strong> common to most programming languages, such as strings enclosed in single or double quotes (like <code>'Mordnilap'</code>) and integers (like <code>14</code>).</p>

<p>TOML also has floating point numbers with decimal points (like <code>3.1415</code> or <code>-42.0</code>) and lowercase Boolean values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Note that <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are written differently in TOML than Python's <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. TOML isn't a Python-specific format, but a general format that can be parsed by many programming languages. In this case, the lowercase <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is similar to JavaScript and JSON's way of writing Boolean values.</p>

<p>Dates and times are also first-class values in TOML; they have a specific format (detailed in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC 3339</a>) and you don't need to write them as strings enclosed in quotes. There are a few different ways of writing them. For dat and timestamps that include the time zone, you can use the <code>Z</code> suffix to mean UTC. Or you can specify an offset from UTC:</p>

<pre>odt1 = 1979-05-27T07:32:00Z  # UTC time zone
odt2 = 1979-05-27T00:32:00-07:00  # UTC minus 7 hours</pre>

<p>The <code>tomli.loads()</code> function takes the above TOML and returns the following Python dictionary:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'odt1'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1979</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">27</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tzinfo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">timezone</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">utc</span><span class="p">),</span>
 <span class="s1">'odt2'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1979</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">27</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tzinfo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">timezone</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">timedelta</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">days</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">seconds</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">61200</span><span class="p">)))}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can also have arrays in TOML, such as our example's <code>inventory = ["apple", "enchanted staff", "healing potion"]</code> producing the Python dictionary <code>{"inventory": ["apple", "enchanted staff", "healing potion"]}</code>. Arrays can also include other arrays.</p>

<p>Instead of dictionaries, TOML has <strong>tables</strong> which can be formed under a square-bracketed table headers:</p>

<pre>[Mordnilap]
class = "Magic user"
maxHP = 14
currentHP = 2

[Bilbo]
class = "Fighter"
maxHP = 16
currentHP = 16</pre>

<p>The <code>tomli.loads()</code> function takes the above TOML and returns the following Python dictionary:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'Bilbo'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'class'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Fighter'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'currentHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'maxHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">},</span>
 <span class="s1">'Mordnilap'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'class'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'Magic user'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'currentHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'maxHP'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">}}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can also use <strong>dotted notation</strong> to create these dictionaries. The following TOML produces an identical dictionary to the previous example:</p>

<pre>Mordnilap.class = "Magic user"
Mordnilap.maxHP = 14
Mordnilap.currentHP = 2

Bilbo.class = "Fighter"
Bilbo.maxHP = 16
Bilbo.currentHP = 16</pre>

<p>But you can also use more compact <strong>inline tables</strong> in TOML:</p>

<pre>Mordnilap = { "class" = "Magic user", "maxHP" = 14, "currentHP" = 2 }
Bilbo = { "class" = "Fighter", "maxHP" = 16, "currentHP" = 16 }</pre>

<p>There's several other aspects to the TOML syntax which you can read in the TOML documentation, but I hope this blog post has given you a good introduction to this helpful tool that will be part of the Python standard library as the <code>tomllib</code> module as of version 3.11.</p>
