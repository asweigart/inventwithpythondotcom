			<p>UPDATE: Felix, the original author of Square Shooter, has made some comments in the comment section that are pretty insightful. I recommend you check them out.</p>
<p>This is a continuation from <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/08/09/source-code-makeover-square-shooter-part-1/">Part 1</a>, where I go through the source code of <a href="http://www.pygame.org/project-Square+Shooter-2430-4094.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pygame.org/project-Square+Shooter-2430-4094.html', 'Square Shooter']);" >Square Shooter</a>, an Asteroids clone, and try to redesign the code to be more readable. (<a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/08/13/source-code-makeover-square-shooter-part-3/">Part 3</a> is also up.</a>)</p>
<p>All of the changes I make <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/tree/master/square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/tree/master/square-shooter', 'can be viewed on github']);" >can be viewed on github</a>.

Just to say this again, readability and software design have an element of subjectivity. The changes I make here aren't necessarily the one true way for this code to be written, and may even be worse (I'm sure you'll be able to check the comments section for people pointing out my errors.)</p>

<h3>Renaming some variables and re-spacing code</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/3acad0029d66c17707ab31da7d88e24ad7577c84#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/3acad0029d66c17707ab31da7d88e24ad7577c84#square-shooter', '(These changes can be seen in the github history.)']);" >(These changes can be seen in the github history.)</a></p>
<p>Grepping to see where <code>GameWorld</code> gets instantiated, I see that the constructor is only called once from line 528 and placed into a global variable named <code>model</code>. Hmmm. I get how the <code>GameWorld</code> is a sort of model, but since the class name is <code>GameWorld</code>, let's rename the <code>model</code> variable to "<code>world</code>" by doing a find-and-replace.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the <code>init_level()</code> method. I'm going to change line 142 from a combination <code>if</code> statment and block to separate lines for the <code>if</code> statement and block:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>if (level > self.max_level):
    self.max_level = level</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a bit more readable. I used the combined approach for the <code>if</code> statement and blocks in the <code>wrap_around()</code> method because the blocks were almost identical to each other, having them on the same line (and lined up) makes it easier to compare each other:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def wrap_around(self):
    """Change the position of the bubble to toroidally "wrap around" if it goes off one edge of the map."""
    if self.pos.x < 0: self.pos.x += 1
    if self.pos.y < 0: self.pos.y += 1
    if self.pos.x > 1: self.pos.x -= 1
    if self.pos.y > 1: self.pos.y -= 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, I'll do the same thing to the <code>Ship</code>'s <code>update()</code> method for those timer decrements (and update the comment, something I forgot to do last time):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># powerups degrade over time until it reaches 0.
if self.has_shield():        self._shield_timer       -= delta_t
if self.has_super_bullets(): self._super_bullet_timer -= delta_t
if self.has_freeze():        self._freeze_timer       -= delta_t</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>death_timer</code> member in <code>GameWorld</code> is the timer that is set after the player dies but before the level is restarted. This name is a bit ambiguous, so I'll rename it to <code>afterdeath_timer</code>. I'll do the same with <code>finish_timer</code>, which counts down after the last bubble has been shot but before the next level begins.</p>
<p>That looks pretty good. I'll just add some comments to <code>init_level()</code> and then check in my changes with the log message, <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/3acad0029d66c17707ab31da7d88e24ad7577c84#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/3acad0029d66c17707ab31da7d88e24ad7577c84#square-shooter', '&quot;Formatting changes and comments to init_level().&quot;']);" >"Formatting changes and comments to init_level()."</a></p>

<p>Now let's look at the <code>GameWorld</code> class's <code>update()</code> method (which is separate from the <code>Ship</code> class's <code>update()</code> method). This is a lot of code that has no comments to help summarize them. All the comments below are mine:</p>

<h3>Refactoring the GameWorld class</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/17b99c9cbeca7f38e0b084aea3eeb8b7278a3bc0#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/17b99c9cbeca7f38e0b084aea3eeb8b7278a3bc0#square-shooter', '(These changes can be seen in the github history.)']);" >(These changes can be seen in the github history.)</a></p>
<p>Now that it has some documentation, let's see how we can improve the <code>GameWorld</code> class. One thing that is odd is that the powerups and explosions are removed if they are too old, and then they are aged. This means that old explosions and powerups won't be removed until the next call to <code>update()</code>. Let's swap the order of that and age them first before doing the age check:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># expand the explosions and delete them once they get too big
for i in self.explosions:
    i.radius += delta_t
if len(self.explosions) > 0:
    if self.explosions[0].radius > 0.5:
        self.explosions.pop(0)

# "age" the powerups on the map, and delete them if they get too old
for i in self.powerups:
    i.age += delta_t
if len(self.powerups) > 0:
    if self.powerups[0].age > 9:
        self.powerups.pop(0)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, there seems to be a slight bug with this code. It only checks if the <strong>first</strong> explosion or power up in the <code>explosions</code> and <code>powerups</code> lists is too old. (You can tell by the <code>self.explosions[0]</code> and <code>self.powerups[0]</code> part.) We should add a loop to these <code>if</code> statements so that every explosion and powerup is checked. (The reason we don't see this bug in the game is because <code>update()</code> is called so frequently that the powerups and explosions are quickly removed in future <code>update()</code> calls.) Notice that we iterate from the end of the <code>self.explosions</code> and <code>self.powerups</code> list to the beginning, because we are modifying the items in the list as we iterate.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># expand the explosions and delete them once they get too big
for i in self.explosions:
    i.radius += delta_t
for i in range(len(self.explosions - 1, -1, -1)):
    if self.explosions[i].radius > 0.5:
        self.explosions.pop(i)

# "age" the powerups on the map, and delete them if they get too old
for i in self.powerups:
    i.age += delta_t
for i in range(len(self.powerups - 1, -1, -1)):
    if self.powerups[i].age > 9:
        self.powerups.pop(i)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's also replace the <code>0.5</code> and <code>9</code> magic numbers with global constants <code>MAX_EXPLOSION_SIZE</code> and <code>MAX_POWERUP_AGE</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>MAX_EXPLOSION_SIZE = 0.5 # set between 0.0 and 1.0
MAX_POWERUP_AGE = 9 # in seconds

...

        # expand the explosions and delete them once they get too big
        for i in self.explosions:
            i.radius += delta_t
        for i in range(len(self.explosions) - 1, -1, -1):
            if self.explosions[i].radius > MAX_EXPLOSION_SIZE:
                self.explosions.pop(i)

        # "age" the powerups on the map, and delete them if they get too old
        for i in self.powerups:
            i.age += delta_t
        for i in range(len(self.powerups) - 1, -1, -1):
            if self.powerups[i].age > MAX_POWERUP_AGE:
                self.powerups.pop(i)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It is more Pythonic to just use not <code>len(self.bubbles)</code> instead of <code>len(self.bubbles) == 0</code> for conditions, since the integer value <code>0</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> anyway:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># check if all the bubbles have been destroyed
if not len(self.bubbles):</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And the variable name <code>i</code> is usually used to mean "index". Since the for loop for updating the bubbles is iterating over <code>Bubble</code> objects instead of an integer index, let's rename <code>i</code> to <code>bubble</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># update all the bubbles
for bubble in self.bubbles:
    bubble.update(delta_t)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's put the <code>self.ship.update()</code> call into an <code>else</code> block. Technically, if we call <code>self.ship.update()</code> unconditionally, then we're simulating <code>delta_t</code> seconds for the ship even though it was just created (on line 205). (This is such a small bug, though, that we haven't noticed it before.)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>else:
    self.ship.update(delta_t)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll check in these changes with the comment <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/17b99c9cbeca7f38e0b084aea3eeb8b7278a3bc0#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/17b99c9cbeca7f38e0b084aea3eeb8b7278a3bc0#square-shooter', '&quot;Improved the GameWorld.update() code.&quot;']);" >"Improved the GameWorld.update() code."</a> after testing my changes.</p>
<h3>Refactoring init_level()</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/ed966a15f7a4a922321d029786a85beb40160554#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/ed966a15f7a4a922321d029786a85beb40160554#square-shooter', '(These changes can be seen in the github history.)']);" >(These changes can be seen in the github history.)</a></p>
<p>Going back to the <code>init_level()</code> code, I realize that rather than use <code>del</code> on the items in the <code>bubbles</code>, <code>explosions</code>, and <code>powerups</code> lists, we can just set those members to blank lists and Python's garbage collector will delete the objects for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># clear out the bubbles, explosions, and power ups from the last level.
self.bubbles    = []
self.explosions = []
self.powerups   = []</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, we can get rid of the <code>for</code> loop and simply use a list comprehension to create all the starting bubbles. This shows us that the <code>self.bubbles = []</code> line wasn't need before:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># clear out the explosions, and power ups from the last level.
self.explosions = []
self.powerups   = []

# create a number of starting big bubbles as the level number.
self.bubbles = [Bubble("big") for i in range(level)]</pre>

<p>I didn't test my changes too thoroughly, and introduced a couple of bugs. There are some times when the player has died and the <code>self.ship</code> member in <code>GameWorld</code> is set to <code>None</code>, but an attribute of <code>self.ship</code> is checked. I've added some <code>self.ship != None</code> checks to these <code>if</code> statements.</p>
<p>The <code>render_ship()</code> method also has a place where we need to do a check for the ship being set to <code>None</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>if self.world.ship != None and self.world.ship.has_super_bullets():
    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, RED, bbox, 1)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I got ahead of myself by accident, I also checked in a change I made to <code>handle_collisions()</code>. Instead of calling <code>b.collides_with(self.bullet)</code> I changed it to <code>self.bullet.collides_with(b)</code>, since it reads better as "the bullet collided with the bubble" rather than "the bubble collided with the bullet".</p>
<p>I've checked these in <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/bedae2d8525803ef00356dc58f65dcde0e969ae6#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/bedae2d8525803ef00356dc58f65dcde0e969ae6#square-shooter', 'here']);" >here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/4348aba88dc2013f27774aad991f8672ae01e6a8#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/4348aba88dc2013f27774aad991f8672ae01e6a8#square-shooter', 'here']);" >here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/70f7b17855f9213952f6db49300e3c3cf2292fea#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/70f7b17855f9213952f6db49300e3c3cf2292fea#square-shooter', 'here']);" >here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to add a new comment that explains that non-super bullets go away when they hit a bubble:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>self.bullet = None # delete the non-super bullet when it hits a bubble</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, there's another place we can change <code>len(self.bubbles) == 0</code> to just <code>not len(self.bubbles)</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>if not len(self.bubbles):
   self.afterfinish_timer = 3</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The code that follows the <code>elif self.ship != None:</code> statement can be simplified. This code checks that if a bubble has hit the ship and handles the player dying. Let's simplify lines 235 to 244:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># check if the bubble has hit the ship
if self.ship != None and b.collides_with(self.ship) and not self.ship.has_shield():
    self.spawn_explosion(self.ship)
    self.ship = None
    self.lives -= 1
    self.afterdeath_timer = 3;
    break</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We can also get rid of the if <code>self.ship == None:</code> return line on line 246. The point of this line is to exit the function if <code>ship</code> is set to <code>None</code>, that way the code that checks if the ship and powerups have collided won't cause errors. But if we want to add code after the powerups collision check, then this function might prematurely exit.</p>
<p>Instead of returning, let's set the code to just skip the powerups collision checks:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>if self.ship != None:
    for p in self.powerups[:]:
        if p.collides_with(self.ship):
            self.apply_powerup(p)
            self.powerups.remove(p)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That's good for now. Let's check this in with the log message, <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/63baedb58bbaaf4730606e4ba36c2534fd8e1156#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/63baedb58bbaaf4730606e4ba36c2534fd8e1156#square-shooter', '&quot;Refactoring handle_collisions()&quot;']);" >"Refactoring handle_collisions()"</a></p>

<p>The <code>spawn_explosion()</code> method looks okay. We'll leave it as is.</p>
<p>The code in <code>mark_score()</code> is a bunch of <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code> statements that change the same variable by different values. Let's put this info in a "kinds" dictionary like we did in the Bubble class:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def mark_score(self, bubble):
    #                   score
    kinds  = {'big':    1,
              'medium': 2,
              'small':  5}
    self.score += kinds[bubble.kind]</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll do the same thing for the <code>apply_powerup()</code> method, but instead of mapping a bubble kind string value to a score integer value, we will use a dictionary to map a powerup kind string value to a function. (Python lets us store functions just like any other value.)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def apply_powerup(self, powerup):
    #                  function to call
    kinds = {'shield': self.ship.add_shield,
             'bullet': self.ship.add_super_bullets,
             'freeze': self.ship.add_freeze}
    kinds[powerup.kind]()</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought about replacing this code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>if self.score > self.high_score:
    self.high_score = self.score</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>...with this code:</p>
<blockquote>

<h3>Fixing a regression</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/5e0957e41bf115a8b358e528a14b8b8ad3c79302#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/5e0957e41bf115a8b358e528a14b8b8ad3c79302#square-shooter', '(These changes can be seen in the github history.)']);" >(These changes can be seen in the github history.)</a></p>
<p>In the process of fixing a bug, I've accidentally introduced a new bug. These kinds of bugs are known as regressions. In GameWorld's update() method, I have this code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>elif self.ship != None and not self.ship.has_freeze():
    # update all the bubbles
    for bubble in self.bubbles:
        bubble.update(delta_t)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This updates the position of all the bubbles, causing them to move around the game map. I added the <code>self.ship != None</code> check so that the <code>not self.ship.has_freeze()</code> wouldn't cause an exception due to the value of <code>self.ship</code> being <code>None</code> (and thus attempting to call <code>None.has_freeze()</code>).</p>
<p>(The second part of the condition, not self.ship.has_freeze(), is not evaluated if the first part, self.ship != None, is True because of <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/chapter10.html#ShortCircuitEvaluation">short-circuit evaluation</a>. In the expression <code>False and blahblahblah</code>, it doesn't matter if <code>blahblahblah</code> is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> because the first part is <code>False</code>, so Python skips checking the second part.)</p>
<p>However, this means that when the ship doesn't exist, the bubble positions don't update. You can see this when the ship gets destroyed: all the bubbles freeze until the player's next life begins. The code should be changed to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>elif self.ship == None or not self.ship.has_freeze():
    # update all the bubbles
    for bubble in self.bubbles:
        bubble.update(delta_t)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/chapter10.html#ShortCircuitEvaluation">short-circuiting</a>, if <code>self.ship</code> is <code>None</code>, then the <code>not self.ship.has_freeze()</code> part of the condition won't be evaluated. (There's no reason to check: the expression <code>True or blahblahblah</code> will evaluate to <code>True</code> no matter if <code>blahblahblah</code> is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, so Python skips it.)</p>
<p>Now when we run the program and die, you can see the bubbles keep moving.</p>
<p>I'll check these changes in under the log message, <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/5e0957e41bf115a8b358e528a14b8b8ad3c79302#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/5e0957e41bf115a8b358e528a14b8b8ad3c79302#square-shooter', '&quot;Fixed a regression where the bubbles freeze after the player dies.&quot;']);" >"Fixed a regression where the bubbles freeze after the player dies."</a></p>
<h3>Refactoring GameScreen</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/577b420a3dadb11719c22117b56e2e98de97c482#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/577b420a3dadb11719c22117b56e2e98de97c482#square-shooter', '(These changes can be seen in the github history.)']);" >(These changes can be seen in the github history.)</a></p>
<p>The first thing I notice is that there is code that does exactly what our <code>WINDOW_WIDTH</code> and <code>WINDOW_HEIGHT</code> constants do:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>self.width, self.height = screen.get_size()</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We can just delete this line since we don't need it anymore, and replace the uses of <code>self.height</code> with <code>WINDOW_HEIGHT</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>self.hud_font =    pygame.font.SysFont(
    font_name, WINDOW_HEIGHT / 10)
self.msg_font = pygame.font.SysFont(
    font_name, WINDOW_HEIGHT / 20)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The code that bases the font size on the window height isn't ideal, because the font sizes are in points and the window size is in pixels, and they don't increase proportional. You can see this for yourself by increasing <code>WINDOW_HEIGHT</code> (and <code>MAP_HEIGHT</code>) and running the program.</p>
<p>Actually, it's a bit annoying that we have to change both <code>WINDOW_HEIGHT</code> and <code>MAP_HEIGHT</code>. Let's add code to the top of the file that sets <code>MAP_WIDTH</code> and <code>MAP_HEIGHT</code> based on the values of <code>WINDOW_WIDTH</code> and <code>WINDOW_HEIGHT</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>WINDOW_WIDTH = 640
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 480

MAP_WIDTH = WINDOW_WIDTH - 160
MAP_HEIGHT = WINDOW_HEIGHT</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, the <code>render_backround()</code> method is misspelled. Let's fix that.</p>
<p>Checking this in with the log message, <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/577b420a3dadb11719c22117b56e2e98de97c482#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/577b420a3dadb11719c22117b56e2e98de97c482#square-shooter', '&quot;Refactoring GameScreen\'s constructor.&quot;']);" >"Refactoring GameScreen's constructor."</a></p>
<h3>Refactoring GameScreen.render()</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/2657bd7ec349b982d4c07c84de1471a35cef83aa#square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commit/2657bd7ec349b982d4c07c84de1471a35cef83aa#square-shooter', '(These changes can be seen in the github history.)']);" >(These changes can be seen in the github history.)</a></p>
<p>The first line in the <code>render()</code> method is a bit of syntactic sugar:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>m = self.world</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so that we only have to type <code>m</code> instead of <code>self.world</code> in this function. The <code>m</code> made sense before we replaced the "<code>model</code>" variable with "<code>world</code>". So we should change this <code>m</code> to <code>w</code>. But really, I think it's more readable just to use <code>self.world</code> instead of <code>m</code>. Let's get rid of this line and change all the m variables to <code>self.world</code>.</p>
<p>The same bit of syntactic sugar is in <code>render_game_world()</code>, so we'll replace <code>m</code> with <code>self.world</code> there too.</p>
<p>The <code>render()</code> code has this weird green-box drawing code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>if self.world.level == 0:
    self.render_title_screen()
    # Hide the [P]ause text.
    self.screen.fill(GREEN, (MAP_WIDTH + 20, 424, 140, 24))
else:
    self.render_game_world()
    # Hide the [P]lay text.
    self.screen.fill(GREEN, (MAP_WIDTH + 20, 400, 140, 24))</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This code is here because the background layer <code>pygame.Surface</code> object has both [P]lay and [P]ause drawn on it, but it only makes sense to show one or the other while the game runs. So this code draws a green box to hide one of the pieces of text.</p>
<p>This is a less than graceful way to handle this. Felix probably wanted to skip rendering the background <code>pygame.Surface</code> object each time the game map was rendered and make the code run faster. But adding a call to <code>self.render_background()</code> in the <code>render()</code> method doesn't introduce any noticeable performance issues, so I'd say this is a case of premature optimization.</p>
<p>Let's add a call to <code>self.render_background()</code> in <code>render()</code>, and also modify the <code>render_background()</code> method to have a parameter that tells it whether or not to render [P]lay or [P]ause. That way we can skip this silly green-box drawing code. (Also, this means we can remove the <code>self.render_background()</code> line from <code>__init__()</code>, since now the background is rendered with the rest of the map.)</p>
<p>Also, I'm going to separate the combined if-and-block line on line 380 into two lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def render(self):
    self.screen.blit(self.bglayer, (0, 0))
    self.render_background(self.world.level)

    if self.world.level == 0:
        self.render_title_screen()
    else:
        self.render_game_world()
        if self.game_paused:
            self.render_pause_text()</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>(Ideally, we'd have some other variable set to track the state of whether or not we show the status screen or the game play screen. But I'll just leave in the convention of level 0 being the status screen for now.)</p>
<p>The <code>render_background()</code> method is altered to either display [P]lay or [P]ause:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def render_background(self, level):

...

    text = self.msg_font.render('[Q]uit', False, WHITE)
    self.bglayer.blit(text, (MAP_WIDTH + 20, 424))

    if level == 0:
        msg = '[P]lay'
    else:
        msg = '[P]ause'
    text = self.msg_font.render(msg, False, WHITE)
    self.bglayer.blit(text, (MAP_WIDTH + 20, 400))</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, let's delete these two commented out lines, since even if we uncomment them they wouldn't work due to a lack of a <code>self.fps</code> variable:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#fps_text = self.msg_font.render(str(self.fps), False, GREEN)
#self.screen.blit(fps_text, (0, 0))</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>render_title_screen()</code> method looks fine. But the other render methods like <code>render_ship()</code>, <code>render_bullet()</code>, and <code>render_powerup()</code> would be better if they were in the <code>Ship</code>, <code>Bullet</code>, and <code>Powerup</code> classes respectively. I'll move them there and simply rename them all <code>render()</code> (just like how the <code>update()</code> name is used by the <code>ObjectOnMap</code> subclasses.) These <code>render()</code> methods will need a parameter for the <code>pygame.Surface</code> object to draw themselves on.</p>
<p>These lines in <code>render_ship()</code> can be removed once this method can be removed after the code is moved to the <code>Ship</code> class, since <code>self.world.ship</code> will just be <code>self</code> and <code>ship.pos</code> will simply be <code>self.pos</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ship = self.world.ship
pos = ship.pos</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the code for the <code>Ship.render()</code> method, compare it to the old <code>render_ship()</code> code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def render(self, surface):
    bbox = pygame.draw.circle(
        surface,
        SILVER,
        scale_and_round(self.pos.x, self.pos.y),
        int(round(self.radius * MAP_SIZE)))

        1)
    if self.has_shield():
        pygame.draw.rect(surface, SILVER, bbox, 1)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's the code to the new <code>Bullet.render()</code> method, compare it to the old <code>render_bullet()</code> code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def render(self, surface):
    bbox = pygame.draw.circle(
        surface,

<h3>Creating render() methods for Bubble and a new Explosion class</h3>

<p>Let's continue the trend of giving classes their own <code>render()</code> methods with the <code>Bubble</code> class:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def render(self, surface):
    pygame.draw.circle(
        surface,
        self.color,
        scale_and_round(self.pos.x, self.pos.y),
        int(round(self.radius * MAP_SIZE)),
        1)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently explosions are just <code>ObjectOnMap</code> objects, since we only needed them to have a radius and position. But we should give them their own class so they can have their own <code>render()</code> and <code>update()</code> methods. Currently this code is handled by the <code>GameWorld</code> and <code>GameScreen</code> classes instead of a unified place.</p>
<p>The new <code>Explosion</code> class looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>class Explosion(ObjectOnMap):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Explosion, self).__init__(0) # explosions start at size 0

    def update(self, delta_t):
        self.radius += delta_t

<h3>Creatind a render() method for Powerup.</h3>

<p>The render() method for Powerup has a lot of code in it since it has to draw three different types of Powerup. We could split the Powerup class into three subclasses, but I think that's object-oriented overkill.</p>
<p>I've created a <code>scaled_x</code> and <code>scaled_y</code> variable inside <code>render()</code> to replace all the <code>scale_and_round(self.pos.x, self.pos.y)</code> calls. The utility of this is negligible. I almost made a <code>scaled_r</code> to replace the <code>int(round(self.radius * MAP_SIZE))</code> expressions. Other than that, the code is mostly untouched.</p>
<p>I've also replaced the <code>i</code> in the <code>for</code> loop with "<code>powerup</code>" since it is not an index:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>for powerup in self.world.powerups:
    powerup.render(self.screen)</pre>

Left in a high powerup chance while testing.&quot;']);" >"Whoops. Left in a high powerup chance while testing."</a></p>
<p>At this point, our <code>render_game_world()</code> method in the <code>GameScreen</code> class looks very straightforward:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>def render_game_world(self):
    self.screen.set_clip((0, 0, MAP_WIDTH, MAP_HEIGHT))

    if self.world.ship != None:
        self.world.ship.render(self.screen)
    if self.world.bullet != None:
        self.world.bullet.render(self.screen)

    for bubble in self.world.bubbles:
        bubble.render(self.screen)

    for explosion in self.world.explosions:
        explosion.render(self.screen)

    for powerup in self.world.powerups:
        powerup.render(self.screen)

    self.screen.set_clip(None)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The code in the <code>render_pause_text()</code> method looks fine, I'll just leave it like that.</p>

<p>Whoops. Those two commented out lines actually did do something useful. The catch is it required you to uncomment a third line that was in the main game loop.</p>
<p>This code displays the current frames per second (FPS) in the upper left corner, which can be useful for measuring performance. Instead of commenting and uncommenting these lines whenever you want to see them, let's add a <code>DISPLAY_FPS</code> global variable that can be set to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, and then put an <code>if DISPLAY_FPS:</code> statement in front of these lines:</p>

<p>The main game loop in the global scope at the bottom of the file continues handling events as long as the <code>running</code> variable is set to <code>True</code>. All of the code that needs to end the program do so by setting <code>running</code> to <code>False</code>. However, since there is no code that runs inside the loop if <code>running</code> is set to <code>False</code>, we can get rid of this variable entirely.</p>
<p>Instead, we'll just have the loop be a <code>while True:</code> infinite loop and the code that previously set running to <code>False</code> will just execute a <code>break</code> instead. That's one less variable we have to deal with.</p>

I think the <code>GameScreen</code> code should probably be merged into <code>GameWorld</code>, and I'd like to take a lot of the <code>GameWorld</code>-specific code out of the globally-scoped game loop. We'll cover that in <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/08/13/source-code-makeover-square-shooter-part-3/">Part 3</a>, as well as making UX (user experience) design changes (instead of just the code design changes we've made in the first two Parts.)</p>
<p>Remember, you can see the full list of git check ins I've made for the code changes on <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commits/master/square-shooter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/asweigart/source_code_makeover/commits/master/square-shooter', 'the github page for this blog post']);" >the github page for this blog post</a> and compare it to <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/square-shooter_original.py">the original source code for Square Shooter</a>.</p>
