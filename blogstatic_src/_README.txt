This folder contains source work files for the blog that are not uploaded to the site. This includes Photoshop files and the voidy bootstrap theme files.

Not that changes to the template files need to be done to C:\Users\Al\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib\site-packages\pelican\themes\voidy-bootstrap-inventwithpython to have the makeblog.bat script work.
