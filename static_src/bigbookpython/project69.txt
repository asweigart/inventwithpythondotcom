<p class="chapterintro">You won’t be able to handle the fast-paced excitement of these racing . . . snails. But what they lack in speed they make up for in ASCII-art cuteness. Each snail (represented by an <code class="calibre17">@</code> character for the shell and <code class="calibre17">v</code> for the two eyestalks) moves slowly but surely toward the finish line. Up to eight snails, each with a custom name, can race each other, leaving a slime trail in their wake. This program is good for beginners.</p>

<p class="bodyfirst">When you run <em class="calibre9">snailrace.py</em>, the output will look like this:</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-289" class="calibre5">How It Works</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">This program makes use of two data structures, stored in two variables: <code class="calibre22">snailNames</code> is a list of strings of each snail’s name, and <code class="calibre22">snailProgress</code> is a dictionary whose keys are the snails’ names and whose values are integers representing how many spaces the snails have moved. Lines 79 to 82 read the data in these two variables to draw the snails at appropriate places on the screen.</p>

<p class="calibre19">After entering the source code and running it a few times, try making experimental changes to it. The comments marked with <code class="calibre22">(!)</code> have suggestions for small changes you can make. On your own, you can also try to figure out how to do the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre25">
<li class="calibre8">Add a random “speed boost” that launches the snail four spaces ahead instead of one.</li>
<li class="calibre8">Add a “sleep mode” that snails can randomly enter during the race. This mode causes them to stop for a few turns and <code class="calibre22">zzz</code> to appear next to them.</li>
<li class="calibre8">Add support for ties, in case snails reach the finish line at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="calibre_link-290" class="calibre5">Exploring the Program</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">Try to find the answers to the following questions. Experiment with some modifications to the code and rerun the program to see what effect the changes have.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li value="1" class="calibre8">What happens if you change <code class="calibre22">snailName[:MAX_NAME_LENGTH]</code> on line 81 to <code class="calibre22">snailNames[0]</code>?</li>
