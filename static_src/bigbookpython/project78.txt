<p class="chapterintro">What does a yellow stone thrown into a blue pond become? Do they have a 4th of July in England? How can a doctor go 30 days without sleep? Whatever you think the answers to these trick questions are, you’re probably wrong. The 54 questions in this program have been specifically crafted so that their answers are simple, obvious, and misleading. Finding the true answer will require some cleverness.</p>
<p class="calibre18">Copying the code from this book will spoil the fun, since you’ll see the answers, so you might want to download and play this game from <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/trickquestions.py" class="linkurl">https://inventwithpython.com/trickquestions.py</a> before looking at the source code.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-322" class="calibre5">How It Works</h2>
<p class="bodyfirst">The <code class="calibre22">QUESTIONS</code> variable holds a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a single trick question and has the keys <code class="calibre22">'question'</code>, <code class="calibre22">'answer'</code>, and <code class="calibre22">'accept'</code>. The values for <code class="calibre22">'question'</code> and <code class="calibre22">'answer'</code> are strings the program displays when it poses the question to the player and reveals the answer, respectively. The value for the <code class="calibre22">'accept'</code> key is a list of strings. If the player enters a response that contains any of these strings, it’s accepted as correct. This allows the player to enter free-form text as their reply. The program is reasonably accurate in detecting when they’ve provided the correct answer.</p>
